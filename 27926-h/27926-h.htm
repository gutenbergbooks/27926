<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>To write something which shall please one's own
friends is one thing; to undertake the task of pleasing
anybody else is another; and, I take it, a far more
difficult one. The writer of the following pages never
sought to sail beyond the peaceful and well-marked area
of the first, until induced&mdash;at the suggestions of his
shipmates, though against his better judgment&mdash;to
venture on the dark and tempest-swept ocean of the
second.</p>

<p>The only originality claimed for the narrative is that
of introducing such a manifestly inferior production to
your notice.</p>

<p>Shipmates, my little bark is frail; deal gently with
her, and&mdash;let me ask it as a special favor&mdash;do not
blow too fiercely on her untried sails.</p>

<p>Much depends on the title of a book. Does it
convey an adequate idea of the subject-matter? I
would claim for mine at least that merit; for is not
every sea over which we have voyaged to the eastward
of England?</p>

<p class="summary">WE COMMISSION OUR SHIP.&emsp;&emsp;VISIT PORTSMOUTH.&emsp;&emsp;PREPARE TO SAIL.</p>


<p>On one of those delicious semi-tropical afternoons,
which geologists tell us once bathed the whole of
our island, and which even now, as though loath to
part from its one-time home, still dwells lovingly in Devonia's
summer, I wended my way to Devonport Park to feast my
eyes once again on the familiar scenes of early days. What
I beheld was a fair picture&mdash;the Hamoaze, with its burden
of shapely hulls, and its beautiful undulating shores of wood
and dell, lay glittering resplendent at my feet. So still and
peaceful was it all that the din of hammers, the whir of
machinery, and the voices of men were all blended in one
most musical cadence. Scores of pleasure-boats dot the
lake-like surface of the noble sheet of water, for the most
part rowed by the lusty arms of those amphibious creatures
familiarly known as "Jack Tars," recently let loose from the
dear old "Model" or the equally dear "Academy." A voice,
bell-like and clear&mdash;surely that of a girl&mdash;invited my closer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>attention; and yes, there she is! and not one only, but
many ones,&mdash;one in each boat, whom Jack is initiating into
that wonderfully difficult branch of navigation&mdash;a sailor's
courtship!</p>

<p>Now, whatever anybody else may say to the contrary, I
hold that the British tar would scarcely be the "soaring
soul" that he is were it not for the influence&mdash;not always a
beneficial influence, by the way, of the softer sex. And
here, a word for him with special respect to what people are
pleased to call his inconstancy. With all his vagaries, and
from the very nature of his calling he has many, I think
there are few other professions which would bear weighing
in the balance with his and not be found as wanting in this
quality. True, none is so easily swayed, so easily led; but
the fault is not his, <i>that</i> must be laid at the doors of those
who compel England's sailors to a forced banishment for
long periods of years, in lands where it is impossible the
home influences can reach them. Is it a matter of much
wonderment, then, if he is swayed by the new and intoxicating
forms which pleasure takes in those far-distant climes
where the eye of Mrs. Grundy never penetrates?</p>

<p>A somewhat curious way in which to commence my
narrative, say you? I think so too, on re-reading it; but
with your permission, I will not dash my pen through it.</p>

<p>Let me, however, make sail and get under way with my
yarn.</p>

<p>Cast we our eyes outward once again, beyond the boats
with their beautiful coxswains&mdash;I mean <i>hen</i>-swains&mdash;to
where that huge glistening iron mass floats proudly on the
main. Reader, that object is the heroine, if I may so say,
of this very unromantic story. She is in strange contrast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>with the numerous wooden veterans around her&mdash;relics of
Old England's fighting days. I thought as I gazed on that
splendid ship that, had I my choice, nothing would suit me
better than to go to sea in her.</p>

<p>A month has passed; it is the 4th of July, in the year of
grace 1878, and my wish is likely to be consummated, for I
find myself on this morning, with several hundreds of others,
taking a short trip across the harbour to the "Iron Duke,"
for so is she named, corrupted by irreverent mariners into
the "Irish Duke."</p>

<p>We skip lightly up the side, or through the ports, bundling
boxes, bags, and hats unceremoniously through anywhere;
and find ourselves, though not without sundry knocks and
manifold bruises, standing on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>With a few exceptions we are all West-countrymen,
undoubted "dumplings" and "duff-eaters"&mdash;at least, so
say our East-country friends, though experience has taught
me, and probably many of my readers too, that at demolishing
a plum pudding the east is not a whit behind the west;
in that particular we all betray a common English origin.</p>

<p>Though our ship's company is, seemingly, young, very
young, the men are growing, and lusty and strong: and bid
fair, ere the end of our commission, to develope into the
ideal British sailor. A stranger, perhaps, would be struck
with their youthful appearance; for strangers, especially if
they be midland men, have an idea that a sailor is a hairy
monster, but once removed from a gorilla or a baboon;
and if we accept the relationship to these candated gentry,
I don't think his ideas would be far out&mdash;say a dozen years
since. But these terrible monsters are all now enjoying
their well-earned pensions in rural quiet, leaving to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>youngsters of this generation the duty of supplying their
places in that great fighting machine&mdash;the navy.</p>

<p>The sailor of to-day possesses, at least, one decided
advantage over his brother of the past. In the olden days&mdash;not
so very olden either&mdash;if one man in a ship's company
could read and write a letter he was considered a genius;
now a sailor is, comparatively, an educated man: and if one
is to be found who cannot read and write well, and accomplish
far more abstruse things with his head, he is dubbed&mdash;a donkey. He
is not now the debauched ignoramus which
has made the English sailor a proverb all over the world.
Education is of little value if it is not capable of changing a
man's habits for the better. There is, however, much room
for improvement in certain national traits; <i>apropos</i> of this,
the "Mail" for September, 20th, 1880, lies before me,
wherein the writer, in a leading article, after giving a description
of the combined squadron at Gravosa, goes on to say,
"It is amusing to find that the traditional impression of an
Englishman prevails so largely at Gravosa, Ragrusa, &amp;c.,
namely, that he is always drunk, or has just been drunk, or
is on the point of being drunk." Great, though, was the
surprise of the honest Ragusans when they discovered that
their estimate of that erratic creature was at variance with
the testimony of their experience of him; for the writer
further adds, "The conduct of our men ashore, the neat,
clean appearance they present, and their orderly and <i>sober</i>
behaviour has been much commented on."</p>

<p>But this is a digression&mdash;let me bring to the wind again.
At the time of our arrival on board neither the captain nor
the commander had joined. The first lieutenant was, however,
awaiting us on the quarter-deck, and who, with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>promptness of an old sailor, allowed no time to be wasted,
but proceeded at once with the work of stationing his crew.</p>

<p>At length every man knows his place on the watch-bill,
and we hurry off to the lower deck to look after our more
private affairs.</p>

<p>It needs not that I enter into a long and dry description
of the peculiar construction of our ship, of the guns she
carries, or how she is fitted out. You yourselves are far
more qualified to do that than I am. After just a cursory
glance at these particulars we see about getting some
"<i>panem</i>," especially as a most delectable odour from the lower
regions assails our nostrils, betraying that that indispensable
gentleman, the ship's cook, has lavished all his art on the
production of a sailor's dinner. "Man is mortal," so we
yield to the temptation, especially as we are awfully hungry&mdash;when
is a sailor not so? Few meals present so much food
for wonderment to the landsman as does a sailor's first dinner
on board a newly-commissioned ship; all is hurry, bustle,
and apparently hopeless confusion. Bags and hammocks
lie about just where they ought not to lie; ditty boxes are
piled anywhere, and threatening instant downfall; whilst
one has to wade knee-deep through a whole sea of hats to
reach a place at the tables.</p>

<p>A jostling, animated, good-natured throng is this multitude
of seamen, intent on satisfying nature's first demand;
for dinner is the only meal, properly so called, a sailor gets.
Nor does it matter much, though the ship's steward has not
yet issued a single utensil out of which we can dine; such
a slight annoyance is not likely to inconvenience men who,
in most things, are as primitive in their mode of living as
were our progenitors in the garden of story. Bear in mind,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>the object we have in view is to clear those tables of their
frugal burdens&mdash;hunks of boiled beef, absolutely nothing
else. What, then, though there be no elaborate dinner service,
so long as the end is attained, and that it is, and in
the most satisfactory and expeditious manner, with scrupulous
neatness and perfect finish, our friends from the shore
must bear witness.</p>

<p>A few words, ere we fall to, descriptive of the lower
deck, which serves us for "kitchen, parlour, and all."
What an altitude between the decks! Can it be that
those concerns up there are meant for the stowage of boxes
and hats? And see, too, this systematic arrangement of
bars, transverse and upright, is it possible they are anything
naval? Their office, though, becomes apparent
when we reflect that there are no hooks, as in wooden
ships, for the hammocks. In this iron age we have
advanced a step, and even sailors can now boast of having
posts to their beds. For the rest, the tables are large and
at a comfortable distance apart; the ports admit a cheerful
amount of light and a wholesome supply of air; and&mdash;but
there goes the pipe "to dinner," so I will pipe
down.</p>

<p>A telegram had been received during the forenoon,
announcing that the captain would join us further on in
the day; and accordingly, at about 4 p.m., he arrived.
A tall, rather slight made man is our future chief, upright
as an arrow, and with an eye such as one sees in men
born to command men. His reputation comes with him
in that vague semi-mysterious manner&mdash;such news does
travel&mdash;and we hear he is a strict "service" officer, and
an excellent seaman&mdash;good qualities both, and such as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>generality of man-of-war's men raise no objection to.
Withal we are told he is "smart," meaning, of course, that
there must be no shirking of duty, no infringement of the
regulations with him. His reputation, I say, came with
him, it stuck to him, and left with him. With the
captain's arrival our first day on board came to an end.</p>

<p>On the 6th the commander joined. In appearance he
is the direct antithesis of the captain, being stout, well
knit, and of medium height&mdash;the ideal Englishman of the
country gentleman type&mdash;bluff and hearty, and with a face
as cheerful as the sun.</p>

<p>Let us now pass rapidly over the few intervening days,
and start afresh from July 17th. So much energy and
determination had been displayed by all hands, that long
before most ships have half thought about the matter we
were ready for sea. In the short space of twelve days, so
far as we were concerned, we were quite capable of voyaging
to the moon&mdash;given a water-way by which to reach
her, especially with such a chief as "Energetic H." at the
helm.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th, there being nothing further
to detain us in Hamoaze, steam was got up, and ere long
we were leaving, for a few years, the old and familiar
"Cambridge" and "Impregnable," the one-time homes
of so many amongst us; and bidding king "Billy" and
his royal consort a long good bye! until Devil's Point
hides from us a picture many of us were destined never
to behold again.</p>

<p>Ere long the booming of our heavy guns, as we saluted
the admiral, announced that we had dropped our anchor
for the first time in the Sound.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>After testing speed on the measured mile, powder and
shell, and other explosives, were got on board and safely
stowed, though it would appear that the engineer authorities
were not satisfied with the results of the steam trial.
A second trial was therefore deemed necessary, and on
this occasion a sort of f&ecirc;te was made of it; for numbers
of officials and un-officials, with their lady friends, came
on board to witness the result. The day was beautifully
fine, and the trip a really enjoyable one&mdash;the cruising
ground lying between the Start and Fowey.</p>

<p>July 22nd.&mdash;The "long-expected" come at last, namely,
the admiral's inspection.</p>

<p>There is a purely nautical proverb, or, at any rate, one
which is so common amongst sailors, that it may be considered
as such, which says "Live to-day live for ever;"
one of those expressions which, somehow, everybody
knows the meaning of, but which none seem to be able
to render intelligible. Well, this idea is peculiarly applicable
to admirals' visits; for if one can manage to live
through such an atmosphere of bustle and worry, such
rushing and tearing, such anxiety of mind, and such
alacrity of movement as follows in the train of the great
man, then surely existence at any other time and under
any other conditions is an easy matter.</p>

<p>It was with peculiar feelings, then, that we received
the august Sir Thomas, over our gangway. Nor were
these feelings modified by the knowledge that Admiral
Symonds is a thorough old "salt," a tar of the old school;
and, as such, is, of course, <i>au fait</i> with the weak points in
a ship's cleanliness and man&oelig;uvring. His inspection
was, I believe, extremely satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>We hoped that with the departure of the admiral we
should have been permitted to land earlier this evening,
as a sort of reward for our late exertions, especially as we
have not seen our homes and families by daylight for
some considerable period. Imagine, then, our feelings
when a signal was thrown out at Mount-Wise that we were
to perform some evolution, which would consume all the
remaining hours of light. But the little cherub on the
royal truck, which, according to Dibdin, is perched at
that commanding altitude, especially to look out that
squalls don't happen to Jack, came to console us in the&mdash;at
other times unwelcome&mdash;shape of a deluge of rain.
Thus we got ashore earlier, though, as a set-off against so
much happiness, wetter men.</p>

<p>On July 26th orders came that we were to proceed to
Portsmouth, to take in our armament of torpedoes, and
in a few hours the Start was growing small astern as we
took our way up channel. We were only a night at sea,
but that a dirty one&mdash;not rough, but foggy&mdash;such as one
usually encounters in this great commercial highway.
Early on the following morning the Isle of Wight lay
abeam, and the view from the sea was most lovely: the
white cliffs of the island, packed in layers like slices of
cake, presenting a learned page out of the book of nature
to the curious. In passing Sandown Bay we caught a
distant view of the operations for raising the "Eurydice."
Our thoughts naturally took a melancholy turn, for many
of us had lost comrades&mdash;some few, friends&mdash;in that ill-fated
ship. But I think one of the leading characteristics
of the sailor is the ease with which he throws off melancholy
at will. The fact is, he encounters danger so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>frequently, and in so many varied shapes and forms, that
if he put on depressing thoughts every time he is brought
face to face with it, then he would be for ever clothed in
that garb.</p>

<p>With a pausing tribute to the dead, and many a silent
prayer, perhaps&mdash;for sailors can and do pray&mdash;we steamed
into Spithead, forgetting, in all probability, the Eurydice
and all connected with her.</p>

<p>As our torpedoes were all ready for us, it was not long
before they were on board and fitted in their places. Our
ship was not originally intended to carry these murderous
weapons, so it was necessary to pierce ports in her sides,
two forward and two aft, that they may be discharged.
The staff of the torpedo school brought with them
twelve of these novel fighting machines, at a cost of about
&pound;300 each, though &pound;500 is the price paid to Whitehead's
firm at Fiume; but as the English Government has the
authority, with certain limitations, themselves to manufacture
the torpedo, they cost England the former price.</p>

<p>After a short trial of the discharging gear outside the
circular forts we shook hands with the land of smoked
haddock and sour bread, and trimmed sails for the west,
reaching the Sound by the following morning, when coaling
lighters attached themselves to us before you could
say Jack Robinson.</p>

<p>Work is again the order of the day; for coaling a large
iron-clad over all means some exertion I can assure you.
It is most unpleasant work, nevertheless it has to be done,
so we set to work with a will. Dirty as the ship was, and
dirty as we all were, from the copious showers of diamond
dust falling everywhere, yet nothing could daunt our
friends from paying us the usual dinner-hour visit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>It was a curious spectacle to witness that farewell visit,
to see coal begrimed men coming up from below, reeking
with sweat, to clasp the fair hand of a mother, to snatch
a kiss from the soft cheek of a sister or sweetheart, or to
feel the lingering embrace of a wife.</p>

GIBRALTAR.</p>


<p>Farewell, farewell! The last words have been
said! How we would have put off that last hour;
how we would have blotted it out, if, by so doing,
we might have avoided that farewell. I never before realised
how impressive a sailor's parting is. Was it really
but a few hours since that loving, clinging hands rested
within our own, that we heard the scarcely breathed
words which still linger in our ears? How like a dream
it all seems, and how like a dream it must continue to be,
until we shall once more hear those voices and feel those
hands.</p>

<p>Thus felt we as on the morn of August, 4th, 1878, just
one month from the hoisting of the pennant, we rounded
the western end of Plymouth Breakwater, <i>en route</i> for the
land of the Celestials. It was Sunday, and never Sabbath
broke fairer than that one, or sun shone more auspiciously
on the commencement of a voyage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Our friends, I doubt not, are casting longing and tear-bedimmed
eyes after us; and many a handkerchief flutters
its good bye long after objects on the shore have
ceased to be distinguishable. Let us leave them to their
tears; for us the sterner realities of life. We are not
going away for ever, I trust; and England's sailors are
patriots enough to feel that their own land, and mothers,
wives, and sisters are the dearest and best in the world.
With a short silent prayer, commending them to God's
protection, we take a last look for good and all, at
old Rame Head, and endeavour if we can to banish
melancholy.</p>

<p>But are we really at sea? for the ship is so steady, and
the water so smooth, that, without the sense of sight, we
have no perception of motion. Sea voyages are, as a
rule, uneventful and monotonous&mdash;to the seaman, at any
rate, and ours was no exception.</p>

<p>A few days after leaving Plymouth we were fairly in the
bay so dreaded by ancient mariners, and which is popularly
supposed to be for ever</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Upheaving, downrolling tumultuously."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many a yarn have I heard old salts spin of this special
and favourite abode of the god of storms: how that the
seas were so high that in the valleys between the wind was
taken completely out of a ship's sails; then, fearful lest
each successive wave would engulf her, her trembling
crew see her up-borne with terrible force, and once more
subject to the full fury of the blast: how that no bottom
was to be reached by the heaviest of leads and the longest
of lines,&mdash;and such-like awe-inspiring wonders; or, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>that most observant of naval poets, old Falconer, graphically
puts it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now quivering o'er the topmast wave she rides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst beneath the enormous gulf divides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now launching headlong down the horrid vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Becalmed, she hears no more the howling gale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till up the dreadful height again she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling beneath the current of the skies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We probably crossed Biscay during the time the presiding
restless spirit was taking holiday or sleeping; for a
lake could not possibly have presented a smoother surface.
Shoals of porpoises, trying their rate of speed under our
bows; the dull flop of a solitary sea-bird astern, seeking
sundry bits of biscuit or other waste; and the everlasting
rythm of the engines were the only occurrences to mar
the sameness of this part of our voyage.</p>

<p>Internally all the activity usually displayed on board a
British man-of-war was being carried on incessantly;
nothing was neglected, and the captain soon led us to see
that "thorough" was his motto, and that for him there
were to be no half measures. Nor did he, during the
time he was with us, ever require of us more than he
was ready to undertake himself. He set us such an
example of zeal and activity, that though we might
not altogether have approved, yet we were bound to
admire it.</p>

<p>It is the fourth day of our voyage, and we are in sight
of the high land of the Torres Vedras, at the mouth of
the Tagus. Far, far away in the background, like a magnificent
panorama, rise the high, time-worn summits of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>the Sierras of Spain. On approaching near enough to
distinguish objects we discovered several large baronial
castles, or convents, perched high up on bold pinnacled
crags, in positions most inaccessible and impregnable.
One goes back, in fancy, to the feudal days, and recalls
those heroes of our boyish imaginations to the times
when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Knights were bold and barons held their sway,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>with all the consequent ills of that system of government.</p>

<p>Our sails are filled with the balmy breath of Portugal's
orange groves as we continue our southward way. Cape
St. Vincent soon rises, Dungeness-like, right ahead, and
we call to mind that this was the scene of one of England's
great naval victories. These rocks, so still and peaceful
now, have resounded to the din of deadly strife, when, in
the year 1797, a Spanish fleet, of twenty-seven sail, tried to
wrest the dominion of the seas from its lawful holders, the
English fleet, under Sir John Jervis, numbering only half
that of the enemy.</p>

<p>Next, never to be forgotten Trafalgar is reached.
Trafalgar, glorious Trafalgar! a household word so long
as England shall endure. How our thoughts love to
dwell on the deeds you witnessed our fathers do, every
man of whom was a hero.</p>

<p>And now arrives Sunday, August 11th, on which day,
after having been favoured with exceptionally fair weather,
Gibraltar, with its mighty rocky fortress, heaves in sight.</p>

<p>Before we arrive at the anchorage I would beg a slight
indulgence of my readers whilst I twist a yarn about
"Gib.;" and as, I think, much of the interest attaching
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>to a place or object is due to a knowledge of its previous
history, I purpose to give just a rapid and cursory glance
at a few of the leading events connected with the past of
the places we visit.</p>

<p>Gibraltar is of Moorish origin, having been named after
the famous Saracen chieftain, Tarik, who made this rock
the starting point of his conquests in Spain. Hence it was
called Gib-el-Tarik&mdash;the hill of Tarik&mdash;further Europeanized
into the modern Gibraltar. This magnificent natural
fortress rises perpendicularly to a height of 1300 feet from
the purple waves of the Mediterranean. It and the peak
Abyla, on the opposite (African) coast, were styled by the
Greeks, in their poetical language, "the pillars of Hercules;"
whilst the strait between is said to have been
executed by the same man of muscle, to wile away the
tedium of an idle hour.</p>

<p>The remnants of this now almost-forgotten race&mdash;the
Saracen&mdash;are still to be found on the northern seaboard
of Africa, in the kingdom called Morocco, where they
strive to eke out a scant existence from the arid plains of
that parched and burning clime.</p>

<p>The events I have recorded above happened hundreds
of years ago. Let us leap the gulf of time, and see if
there be anything else worthy of note or interest as
bearing upon Gibraltar. I think there is&mdash;much that
is interesting to Englishmen. In 1704, Sir George Rooke
and Admiral Byng had made several attempts to engage
the French fleet, but had signally failed. Deeming it
undesirable to return to Plymouth in this inglorious
manner, the two leaders determined to win laurels for
themselves and fleet somehow and somewhere&mdash;it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>mattered
not where, and they decided on making a bold
attempt on Gibraltar.</p>

<p>It was during this memorable attack that the signal
gallantry of the Royal Marines displayed itself in so
brilliant and wonderful a manner&mdash;gallantry which has
shed such lustre on the annals of naval warfare, and gained
for them a name and a place second to none in the
British army.</p>

<p>In 1713, on peace being proclaimed, the fortress was
ceded to England in perpetuity; but the Spaniards had
no intention of abiding by a treaty wrung from them at
such a cost. The result was that several subsequent
attempts were made to regain the place. At length, in
the years 1789-93, occurred that memorable siege&mdash;the
greatest, perhaps, on record&mdash;when a mere handful of
British soldiers, under General Elliott, successfully withstood
a siege of three years' duration, which settled at
once and, let us hope, for ever the question as to who
were henceforth to be masters here. But it is a bitter pill
to the Spaniards; and even now they can scarcely realize
that it does not belong to them. The Spanish people are
continually being buoyed up with the pleasant fiction, that
it is only <i>lent</i> to its present proprietors; for in all documents
relating to Gibraltar, or in all questions raised in
the Spanish parliament touching that place, the British
are referred to as being only "<i>in temporary possession of
Gibraltar</i>."</p>

<p>The view of the town from the bay is rather pleasing.
Before us and far away to the left, till hid by an eminence,
the houses stand out boldly, terrace above terrace, against
the rocky background&mdash;their white mass and gaily-colored
verandahs glistening in the sunbeams.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>To prevent loss of time, instead of anchoring we were
at once secured alongside the jetty, thus offering a fine
opportunity for sight-seers, who speedily throng the wharf.
A most motley gathering that same crowd, a few were
undoubtedly British, therefore nothing need be said of
them&mdash;a few more, half-blooded Spaniards; and as we
shall become better acquainted on our visiting the town,
we will pass them without comment also; but one remarkable
race, which has its representatives amongst the sea of
faces before us, needs a few words of remark. Their
proud, commanding bearing, clearly-cut features&mdash;as if
just from the sculptor's chisel, their sallow complexion&mdash;almost
approaching a saffron hue, all are new to us. Red
fez caps on a close-shaven head, loose flowing scarlet
tunics, bare legs, and sandalled feet&mdash;these clearly betray
their oriental origin. Who are they? Reader, a few
pages back I endeavoured to claim your interest in a
people who once owned half Spain&mdash;the Moors: these
before you are some of their descendants, and are a
portion of the army of the Sultan of Morocco, here for
the purpose of receiving instruction in gunnery. Though
they have such proud looks they are extremely bashful
and restive under our gaze, constantly shifting their
position to escape our scrutiny; as for making a sketch
of one, that is nearly impossible, for immediately he sees
you put your pencil to paper he vanishes in the crowd, as
though he had detected you levelling a revolver at him.</p>

<p>The other dwellers on the soil are a strange mixture of
the Mediterranean race; and as it is impossible to describe
them, or say what they are, we will just be content with
the title they are proudest of&mdash;the reptilian one of "rock
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>scorpions"&mdash;a tough, hardy people, though, notwithstanding
their doubtful ancestry.</p>

<p>In my description of places I shall always assume that
about twenty or thirty of my shipmates accompany me in
my strolls,&mdash;we shall get along much pleasanter, and enjoy
ourselves much better thus than if we were scattered
without any end in view: besides, it will be much less
difficult for me, and I shall be enabled to get rid of that
objectionable personal pronoun, first person singular,
nominative. I will, therefore, with your kind co-operation,
introduce you to the first of our series of rambles.</p>

<p>The climate is beautiful and the air most exhilirating,
two, at any rate, of the attributes to an enjoyable walk
already manufactured for us. Passing out of the Dockyard
precincts we are at once in the English quarter. As
I said before, the houses are constructed in terraces:
hence we find ourselves continually mounting flights of
steps to get from one street to another, so that there is
really little inducement for pedestrians to move out of
doors at all. Vegetation is very scarce, a want we can
scarcely be surprised at when we consider the soil. Of
course, that camel of the vegetable world, the cactus tribe,
has its representatives in this arid, parched earth, where,
seemingly, it is impossible anything else can take root.</p>

<p>As we approach the rising ground, which hides a portion
of the town from our view, we observe the walls of an
old ruin boldly outlined against the pure blue of the sky.
This is all that now remains of a Moorish castle, the last
existing monument of that race in Gibraltar.</p>

<p>But we must hurry on, for we have a lot to do: amongst
other things, a climb to where that flag flutters indistinctly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in the breeze. After sundry twists and turns, now up
these steps, now down this street, or that, we find ourselves
at the beginning of the ascent, and in as rubbly
and dusty a pathway as one would wish to traverse. What
with the ruts worn by the rain, and the tearing up of the
ground by the passage of heavy ordnance, it would be a
difficult matter indeed to select any particular line of
march and call it a road. Travellers ordinarily engage
mules for the journey; we sailors scorn any such four-footed
assistance, though the next time we voyage this
way it will be as well to remember that ankle boots are
preferable to "pursers' crabs." As we advance, the sun's
rays are beginning to get unpleasantly warm, whilst the
sand most persistently ignores all the known laws of
gravity, by fixing itself in our eyes, mouths, and nostrils.</p>

<p>Herds of goats, with their attendant shepherds, occasionally
cross our path, changing their pasturage. Query,
what do they live on? I don't think that any of our
party have yet seen anything green since we started, not a
blade of grass nor even a moss to relieve the stony reality
of the hard rock.</p>

<p>With what a sigh of relief and satisfaction we reach the
top, and enter within the welcome shade afforded by the
signal-house. Refreshments are eagerly sought after, anything
to wash the dust out of one's mouth. There is no
lack of drinks here, very fortunately; beer and stout, and
something&mdash;which being put into lemonade bottles passes,
I suppose, for that beverage&mdash;are speedily, greedily, gulped
down our parched throats. The supposed lemonade
which, by special desire, fell to my lot, was enough to
engender thoughts of disloyalty to a certain lady and her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>cause in the mind of the stoutest champion of the league;
and I took considerable credit to myself that I passed
scathless through such a trying ordeal. What stuff! Just
imagine, you who are drinking your stout with such keen
relish, and smacking your lips in such evident satisfaction,
imbibing a liquid as hot almost as the surrounding air,
and so insipid that I have tasted medicines far more
palatable. Opportunely I call to mind a proverb of our
Spanish friends yonder, "The sailor who would caulk his
boat must not turn up his nose at pitch;" and as, figuratively
speaking, I want to caulk mine, I make a virtue of
necessity, and the obnoxious liquid vanishes.</p>

<p>Having regaled ourselves at a very moderate cost, all
things considered, we are invited to insert our names
in the visitors' book. To satisfy a curiosity we possess
we turn back over the pages, to see who has honored this
height with their presence. We find princes from
Germany, grandees from Spain, professors from America,
naval officers of almost all nations, and ladies not a few.
One person of a witty and poetical turn thus records his
and his friends' visit:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>After such an enjoyable rest, suppose we just step outside
on the terrace, and have a look around whilst we
"do" our tobacco.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>We are at a height of 1255 feet above the level of the
sea; and the fatigue of the ascent is more than compensated
by the view of the splendid natural panorama, spread
out like a map around us. The bay of Gibraltar, with the
houses of the town of Algeciras, are distinctly visible;
so, too, is the southern range of the Ronda mountains,
the purple Mediterranean, with the immense jumble of
Afric's sparkling shores, the Atlas mountains, the Neutral
ground, and the Spanish lines. These are some of the
objects which never tire the eye. The precipices below us
are amazingly steep, in some cases the heights even overhang.
Many precious lives were lost through inadvertent
steps during the first occupation; and this suggests to me
a story I have read somewhere, and which I will ask your
pardon for telling you.</p>

<p>A young officer of the garrison, who with a brother
officer was on guard one day, suddenly missed his companion;
and on retracing his steps a little he saw his poor
friend's mangled body about 400 feet below. The sub,
however, made no reference or allusion to this accident in
his report. His commanding officer, on being informed
of the sad business, immediately summoned his subordinate
before him, and demanded an explanation of his
conduct, the following dialogue taking place between
them:&mdash;"You say, sir, in your report, 'N.B.&mdash;nothing
extraordinary since guard mounting,' when your brother
officer, who was on guard with you, has fallen over a precipice
400 feet high and been killed! call you this
nothing?" Our sub, who hailed from 'auld reekie,' thus
replied, "Weel, sir, I dinna think there is onything extraordinary
in that; had he fa'n doon a precipice 400 feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>high, and <i>not</i> been killed, I should ha'e thocht it vera
extraordinary indeed, and would ha'e put it doon in my
report!"</p>

<p>I think we have found the down journey not nearly so
difficult or wearying as the ascent, for we are in the town
ere we are aware of it, and following in the wake of a
throng of people, seemingly all heading in one direction.
As we have still a few hours left us we will accompany
them, and make a study of Spanish life by gaslight.</p>

<p>Graceful, black-eyed women, instinct with loveliness
and vivacity, claim our first notice&mdash;first, because they
are ladies, and, secondly, because of their becoming attire
and the natural grace of their movements; for theirs is
"the very poetry of motion." We have all possibly seen
pictures of Spanish women, and may have, no doubt,
remarked the head-gear they were depicted with. The
flowing lace adornment, reaching from the head to the
shoulders, and from thence thrown in graceful folds over
the back and one arm, is called the "mantilla," and is the
characteristic costume of the ladies of Spain. Each carries
a fan in her hand&mdash;no lady is dressed without it&mdash;which
they use, not so much for the purpose of cooling
themselves as to convey the subtle emotions of the
Spanish female mind. It seems to do the duty of eyes,
though they possess very beautiful eyes, too. What I
mean is, that whereas we in our colder climate generally
indicate love, passion, or melancholy by means of the eyes
principally, and through the facial muscles generally, these
ladies interpret all this through the agency of the fan. So
skilled are they in its use, that there is scarcely an emotion,
it is said, which they cannot render intelligible by this
means.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>To say that we passed them without an impertinent
stare is to confess at once that we are not sailors. This
want of manners, or seeming want, is excusable, I think,
insomuch that in our everyday life we see so little of
them, that when we do fall across "the sex" we regard
them more in the light of curiosities than tangible flesh
and blood like ourselves. I see, too, that some of the
more susceptible of our party are looking behind them.
"Remember Lot's wife," and remember, too, the blue-eyed
girls of your village homes whom you parted from so
recently; for the Spanish maids, with all their charms,
will scarcely bear comparison with our bonnie English
lasses.</p>

<p>We have said something of the "<i>senoras</i>," now a word
for the "<i>senors</i>." The dress of the men is as picturesque
and gaudy as that of the ladies is not; in the particular,
indeed, the sexes seem to have usurped the other's rights.
Young Spanish swells, in colored velvet breeches and tastefully
embroidered leggings, scarlet silk sash around the
loins, and irreproachable linen, with, here and there, one
with the far-famed guitar, improvising amorous nothings
for the ear of some susceptible damsel, abandon themselves
to the luxury of the hour in true Spanish style.</p>

<p>But what is this? Whither has the crowd conducted
us? Surely the fairies have been at work! In other
words, we have wandered into the Alameda, or Public
Gardens. I beg to recall a statement which I fear I made
somewhat rashly a few pages back, in which I said that
Gibraltar could not possibly yield any green thing, owing
to its miserable soil. I find I am wrong, for here before
us is a perfect greenery. Stately trees, beautiful blossoms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>fragrant and gaily-flowered shrubs, ferns and grasses&mdash;all
are here in abundance. How charming it all looked by
the light of many colored lamps! These gardens are
evidently the favorite promenade of all classes of the
people&mdash;the Spanish don, the English officer, the Southern
Jew, and the swarthy African&mdash;all find a place in its
walks, and glide along its various avenues in twos or
threes, according to taste. The strains of the Garrison
band, too, invite us to linger yet, as the sweet airs of the
reminiscences of Scotland whisper among the branches.
Sombre-clad priests, in long togas and shovel hats, bustle
about here and there, now talking cheerfully to one lady,
now looking correction at another; but all enjoying themselves
with as much evident pleasure as their more
mundane flocks.</p>

<p>The boom of the Citadel gun cuts short all our pleasing
reflections, and we may (very unwillingly it must be confessed)
tear ourselves away from this happy place.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Dockyard gates we are summoned to
give the pass-word by the vigilant guard before we are
allowed to pass the ponderous portal. Those who have
read Captain Marryatt's delightful story, "Peter Simple,"
and I should hope there are few sailors who have not, will
perhaps recall the amusing scene which took place on
this very spot between lieutenant O'Brien and the soldier
on guard.</p>

<p>Our days at pleasant "Gib." are drawing to a close. I
feel assured that we shall carry with us, in our voyage to
the far east, many pleasing recollections of Gibraltar&mdash;its
balmy air and genial climate&mdash;its abundance of grapes,
melons, and oranges. Would we could send some to our
friends in England.</p>

<p class="summary">UP THE MEDITERRANEAN.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;MALTA.</p>


<p>With the dawn of August 15th we were rounding
Europa Point, and leaving Gibraltar far away
astern. On our starboard hand three or four
luminous points in the atmosphere indicate the position
of the snow peaks of Atlas, the range itself being lost in
the distance.</p>

<p>We chanced on a favoring breeze, so all sail was spread
to help us against the strong five knot current always
setting out from this sea. I cannot tell with what feelings
you entered upon this, the greatest highway of commerce
in the world. For all of us it possesses a certain interest,
but to some more so than to others. I refer to those who
love to wander in imagination amidst the departed glories
of Greece and Rome&mdash;empires which lived, moved, and
had their being when our forefathers were but tattooed
savages.</p>

<p>As we advance, the sea begins to widen, the mountainous
outline of the Spanish coast trends boldly to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>northward; whilst the African shore grows indistinct and
flatter, save where here and there some mighty peak rears
its head from out of cloudland. Since leaving "Gib." we
have been under the escort of shoals of porpoises, who
ever and anon shoot ahead to compare rate of speed; or,
by way of change in the programme, to exhibit their fishy
feats under the ship's bows. Whether there be any truth in
the mariners' yarn, that the presence of porpoises generally
indicates a change in the wind, I will leave for you to
form your own opinion; but certain it was, that on the
present occasion, the wind did change, and to a "muzzler"
illustrating in the most practical manner that our
ship could be just as lively on occasion as other pieces of
naval architecture. The stomachs of some of our
younger hands, too, seemed to have suddenly acquired a
sympathetic feeling with the movements of the ship,
which, strangely enough, impressed them with a desire to
reveal what they had had for dinner. The ship, though,
dashed onward like a mad thing, regardless of the agony
she was inflicting on some of her human parasites.</p>

<p>This was but the commencement of our sufferings for
now the heat was beginning to annoy us. To us who
could go on deck when we wished it was bad enough, but
to those poor fellows who had to swelter and toil in the
stokehole it must have been very trying, though compared
with what was yet to come this was a mere bagatelle. We
had encountered that blasting wind known as the
"sirocco"&mdash;the scourge of the Mediterranean&mdash;which
after gathering force and heat in the African deserts
comes with its fiery and sand-laden breath to sap the
moisture from all who have not the natures of salamanders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Fortunately we soon passed beyond its sphere of
action.</p>

<p>Darkness rapidly sets in in these regions of eternal
summer. The sunny shores and genial climes of the
Mediterranean, where the very touch of the air seems a
perfumed caress, lack only one thing to make them a
paradise. Those pleasant hours which obtain in our less
favoured land after the sun has set, and which we call
twilight, are entirely unknown here, hours which England's
youths and maidens generally appropriate to
themselves, and which, in after years, recall some of the
sweetest memories of their lives. Fancy a day deprived
of such hours! No sooner has Ph&oelig;bus veiled his
glorious beams than there is a general demand for
candles, and we find our liberal supply of two 'dips' a
very inadequate apology for about four hours' illuminating
purposes on a draughty deck.</p>

<p>But we must haste on our way past the Tunisian Coast,
past Galita, onward through fleets of lateen rigged
piratical looking crafts, with snowy sails and bird-like
movements, dashing their white wings in the surge. We
must not dwell too long on this peaceful and pleasant
shore, for Pantellaria&mdash;an island of more interest in one
sense&mdash;begins to rise ahead. This, in all probability, is
the "Calypso's Isle" of the classics, but now the less
poetical "Botany Bay" of the Italians. I should think
that a few years' compulsory residence here is a thing to
be desired rather than not, for it is a delightful spot
enough, a sort of embryo continent, and nature seems to
have achieved here some of her grandest works in the
smallest possible space and with the least possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>amount of material. As we near its shore we catch a
glimpse of a pure white town, gracefully reclining on the
slopes of a hill at the head of a perfect miniature of a
bay. Artistically the effect is very pleasing, the glistening
white houses seem as if embowered in the darkest of
green foliage, each roof, each angle standing out most
distinctly. Much as we regret it we see charming Pantellaria
vanishing astern, for our engines will not cease their
everlasting plunges to satisfy any weaknesses of ours.</p>

<p>How wonderfully strange and new everything seems to
us; the sea, the land, its peoples, all so different to
England; even the very heavens shed milder lights, have
purer depths of colour. At night the stars shine out
larger and with greater brilliance than we are wont to see
them. Our old friend, the Great Bear, still remains true
to us, though he keeps shorter watches in our southward
way, others less loyal, forsake us altogether, yet in
exchange if we get new forms they are not less beautiful.</p>

<p>Brilliant as are the skies the sea is equally so, for there
seem as many gems beneath as above us; we appear to
be cleaving our way through a yielding mass of liquid
gold. Every dash the ship makes she seems to set the
sea on fire, throwing starry sprays far over our heads on
to the deck where the drops still retain their light.</p>

<p>At early morning on August 22nd, a great jabbering
outside the ship, as though a colony of monkeys had
encountered another babel, announced that we were at
Malta. Boats by the hundred swarm around us, and never
was seen such a gesticulating, swearing crowd, as their
occupants, nor such pushing and hauling, such splashing
and wrangling, and even fighting to maintain their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>stations alongside. One's eyes cannot fail to be arrested
by these boats, but the colouring of them is what attracts
particular attention. We get here our first idea of the
criental love for colour, though at Malta the idea is exaggerated,
because the colours do not blend harmoniously.
For instance, the same boat will be painted with emerald
green, vermillion, cobalt, and chrome yellow, put on
without the slightest regard to effect or harmony. The
eye on the bow is universal, no waterman would dare
venture from the shore without such a pilot.</p>

<p>These little crafts, in addition to their legitimate use,
have a secondary, though very important one, that of
advertising mediums, not unworthy the genius of our
American cousins. To select an example here and there.
One boat bearing the characteristic and truly Catholic
legend "Nostra Senora di Lordes," also sets forth another
legend to the effect that "Every ting ver cheap here
Jack," though <i>what</i> is cheap and <i>where</i> is not so clearly
indicated; on another this extraordinary piece of English,
"Spose you cum my housee, have got plenty." Of
these same "housees" numerous tales are told; of one
in particular, where you can obtain "ebery ting" except
the right. You ask for beef steak, or ham and eggs, and
the master of the house, in the blandest manner and with
much shrugging of the shoulders, will answer you, "Me
ver sorry, hab got ebery ting but that," and ditto to your
next order, he has also the sang froid to tell you on your
complaining of the toughness of that succulent, that his
cabbage must be tender because it has been boiling <i>ever
since the "Caledonia" went home</i>. If you don't enjoy it
after that, all that I can say is you are over fastidious.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>But to return to the busy and noisy throng alongside.
Its composition differs very little from that usually encountered
by ships of war in all parts of call. The washerwomen
are the undoubted masters of the situation, and
carry all before them. The alacrity with which they
scramble up the perpendicular side of the ship is simply
astonishing. It struck me that we could not do it with
greater ease, notwithstanding that we possess the advantage
of unfettered extremities. In the twinkling of an eye
they are below, and besieging us in our messes, holding
out for our inspection greasy looking rolls of paper,
purporting to set forth in English, French, Italian and
Spanish, and even in Greek and Turkish, the bearers'
exploits amidst the soap suds. To read the English
certificates while at breakfast is highly amusing and provocative
of much merriment. Here is one. The writer
is one "Bill Pumpkin," H.M.S. "Ugly Mug," who states
that the holder, Mary Brown (who does not know Mary
the ubiquitous Mary), "has a strange knack of forgetting
the gender of a shirt, for it not unfrequently happens that
you may find her with that article of male apparel on her
own 'proper person,' otherwise, he says, she is all that
can be desired." The said Mary B being unable to read
English&mdash;or for that matter any other language&mdash;holds up
her paper in triumph. Happy, ignorant Mary!</p>

<p>Having squared yards with the black-eyed nymphs (all
the shady side of thirty), we are next assailed with the
milkmen, who not only bring their cans, but also their
goats on board. When the can is run out "nanny" is
milked, and sent about to look for a feed under the mess-tables,
a locality she is thoroughly acquainted with from
frequent experience.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Our first breakfast in Malta is over, a meal not easily to
be forgotten, for fruit is plentiful and good and very
cheap, and milk equally so, and cans full of the latter
added to the chocolate make that nutritious beverage
truly delightful, while luscious grapes supply a wholesome
and refreshing dietary.</p>

<p>Now for a run on shore. Valetta, or la Valette, in
honor of one of the most famous of the Grand Masters,
the modern capital of Malta, is a fairly large place, though
by no means extensive enough to be styled a City, except
out of courtesy. How dingy the buildings and how
dusty the pavements from the crumbling masonry. The
houses are so lofty that the strip of blue sky can scarcely
send its light to the bottom, whilst the upper storeys have
such an affectionate leaning towards each other, that the
wonder is that any mortar is capable of restraining their
eagerness to fall on each other's necks. But all the
houses are not like this, and the character of the masonry
speedily improves on emerging from the gloomy alleys
into the magnificent Strada Reale, more of a roadway
than a street, for though there are many grand edifices
and numerous shop fronts, yet one may walk to Floriana
on the one hand, and to Civita Vecchia on the other,
without turning to the right or left.</p>

<p>This crowded thoroughfare presents at this special time
in particular a most cosmopolitan appearance, for we
have dropped in at Malta during the sojourn here of the
Indian Contingent, brought to Europe in anticipation of
difficulties with Russia.</p>

<p>The Maltese themselves, though unquestionably a small
race, are wiry and capable of enduring great hardships.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>They are very skilful artisans, the filigree jewellery of
their silversmiths, for example, is unequalled as a work of
art by anything of its kind in Europe. They are splendid
divers, and seem equally at home in the water as on the
land; the smallest coin thrown overboard being brought
to the surface in a twinkling. Whatever their original
language might have been, that which they now possess is
a most animated one; for they throw their spars about in
a most alarming manner in emphasis of what they say,
inclining one to the belief that sailors have of this people,
namely&mdash;if you tie a Maltese hands he can't speak.</p>

<p>Just a word or two descriptive of the sexes: the men
we will dismiss with a few words; they are, as I said
before, below the medium height, with dark Italian faces
and eyes, but otherwise not remarkable. The women are,
though, or perhaps I ought to have said their appearance
is. Landing in Malta for the first time, a stranger is apt
to conclude that every woman he sees is either a sister of
mercy or a nun. This is due, in a great measure, to their
national costume, about the only national possession they
can now boast of, which consists of a loose gown of rusty
black and a hood-like covering over the head and
shoulders, also black. This construction throws their
face&mdash;a rather comely one&mdash;into deep shade, almost as
sombre-looking as their dress. No doubt if they could
be induced to wear the various so-called aids to nature
which our ladies use to make "a good figure," the Maltese
women might do as an advertisement for Worth; but
under the present system of dressing well, I would
guarantee to produce as shapely a structure out of a
stuffed bread bag with a spun-yarn around its middle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>If a people be religious, in proportion to the number of
priests and sacred edifices seen in their midst, then ought
the Maltese to be pre-eminently a devout people; for it
seems as if every third building is a church, and every
other man one meets a priest; whilst the incessant and
not always melodious clanging of bells all day long, is a
constant reminder that there is no lack of opportunity for
devotees.</p>

<p>So far as the outward appearance of the priests may be
taken as the index to the man's worldly position, I should
pronounce their calling anything but a lucrative one; for
a more seedy-looking class is rarely to be met with. Their
care-worn faces and rusty and tattered garments testifying
that in Valetta, at least, the proverbial easy and jolly life
of the priesthood does not prevail.</p>

<p>In spite of the lack of good building material, there
are some very fine buildings in Malta&mdash;notably, the palace,
the cathedral of San Giovanni, and the opera house. The
palace has its immediate entrance from the Strada Reale,
by means of an arched gateway of Oriental design, whilst
iron railings extend along the whole front of the structure
on either side the gate. Within is the palace square,
beautifully and tastefully laid out with rare exotics and
flowering trees, floral designs and fish ponds. A grand
marble stairway indicates the direction we are to take to
reach the interior of the pile, at the head of which is a
sort of vestibule, or hall, when all further progress is
barred by the presence of one of the palace functionaries.
We explain our errand, said functionary demurs, pulls a
long face, makes sundry excuses as to its not being the
proper day and so on, whilst all the time he is making a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>mental calculation as to the value of the expected "tip."
The workings of that man's mind are as patent as the
day. An English shilling speedily smooths the wrinkles
off that puckered brow as if by a miracle, and makes us
the best of friends. What wonders the little medallion
portrait of the Majesty of England will work, what hearts
soften, what doors unlock, and what hypocrites make!
With a flattering and obsequious bow our guide leads the
way.</p>

<p>The palace was built by the Knights as their regal
residence, and as everything in it has been most religiously
preserved, the various rooms will present a pretty fair
picture of the manner of life of these soldier priests,
whose portraits adorns the walls around. To the frame
of each a metal label is attached, on which is an inscription
in Latin, setting forth the patronymic and virtues of
the original. Some are represented in military armour
with bold martial air, whilst others are depicted in the
more peaceful garb of priests, or civilians, but all wear
the sash and cross, peculiar to the Order, the latter
symbol&mdash;known as the Maltese Cross&mdash;being found on
all their coins and possessions.</p>

<p>Out of the portrait gallery folding doors admit us to
the Parliament House, where the Government officials
assemble for the conduct of State business. The four
walls are enriched and adorned with wonderful specimens
of needlework, testifying to the patience and skill of the
knights' fair friends.</p>

<p>But the most interesting place of all is the armoury, a
vast hall at right angles to the picture gallery, in which
are weapons and arms of all sizes, workmanship, and ages;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>from the light rapier and fencing helmet for friendly
practice, to the two-handed sword and iron casque of
thirty pounds weight, for the more deadly strife. Some
highly interesting relics are here, too, the original document
whereby Charles V. tendered the island to the
Knights&mdash;a consumptive looking cannon with very large
touch-holes and very small bores&mdash;stone shot, iron shot,
lead balls, all arranged in neat designs. Suits of armour
of delicate filigree work, in silver and gold, in glass cases;
other suits less costly, though of equal ingenuity, ranged
along the walls in erect positions, spear in hand, or
leaning on a huge sword. From the size and weight of
some of these suits, I opine, the Knights must have been
men of large build, a medium sized suit being rather the
exception than otherwise.</p>

<p>After a glance at the old, lumbering State carriage of
Bonaparte, with its faded, gilded trappings and armorial
emblazonry, we haste away to view something else.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the Palace, comes the Church of
St. John (San Giovanni), by far the finest building in
Malta. The interior is very gorgeous, with gilded vaulted
roof, finely carved pulpits, rare old crimson tapestries
and monumental floor, resembling one enormous heraldic
shield. Beneath, lie the mouldering remains of the
defunct knights, the arms of each being represented on
the slabs above them, in the most delicate and accurate
designs, in some cases stones more rare and costly than
marble being used.</p>

<p>At the end of the eastern aisle is the Chapel of the
Madonna, guarded by massive silver bars, saved from the
rapacity of Napoleon's soldiers by the cunning and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>ingenuity of a priest, who, perceiving that Bony's
followers had very loose ideas of mine and thine, painted
the rails wood colour, and thus preserved them inviolate.</p>

<p>Once more in busy, bustling, Strada Reale, with its
gay shops filled with a tempting display of gold and silver
filigree work, corals and laces, the latter very fine specimens
of needlework indeed.</p>

<p>Thus far, we have performed all our movements on
foot, but now, as we have to go a rather long distance
over very uninteresting ground, we think it more convenient
to sling our legs over a horse's back, for the
journey to Civita Vecchia, better known to sailors as
"Chivity-Vic." This was the former capital of the
island, though now, as deserted almost as Babylon, its
streets overgrown with grass, its buildings crumbling ruins,
and echoing to the tread of our horses' hoofs. But it is
not so much to view these ruins that I have brought you
here, as to visit the Catacombs, or subterranean burying
grounds of the early inhabitants. These are not much
compared with those at Naples, or Palermo, for instance,
but to those who have seen neither the one nor the other,
they will present all the charm of novelty. Though only
a charnel house it is laid out with great care, in street,
square, and alley, just like the abodes of men above.
The bodies are mostly in a fine state of preservation,
reposing in niches cut out of the dry earth, some of the
tombs being double, others, again, having an additional
crib for a child. It is next to impossible that organic
matter can fall to decay, owing to the extreme dryness of
the place, and, except that the colour has changed a little,
the dead people around would have no difficulty in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>recognizing their own faces again if brought suddenly to
life. Some of the bodies seem actually alive, a deception
further borne out by their being clothed in the very garments
they wore when sentient, joyful dwellers, in the
city above. It is worthy of remark that, though there is
but one and the same means of ingress and egress, the air
is wonderfully pure, and free from any offensive odour or
mustiness.</p>

<p>Its extreme dryness though, seems somehow to have
a reciprocal effect on the palates of our party, for I hear
vague murmurs of "wanting something damp," which,
by-an-bye, break out into a general stampede. If there be
any bye-laws in existence against hard riding, we are
happily ignorant of them, nor have we the slightest
sympathy with anxious mothers, whose dusky and grimy
offspring are engaged at a rudimentary school for cookery
in the mud of the road. Sailors, as a rule, don't note
such items.</p>

<p>August 25th, to-day, after a rather short stay, we looked
our last, for some years, on "the fair isle"&mdash;St. Paul's
Melita.</p>

RED SEA.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;ADEN.</p>


<p>The voyage from Malta to Port Said was accomplished
without any notable event, except that the heat goes
on steadily increasing.</p>

<p>August 31st, to-day, we made the low-lying land
in the neighbourhood of Port Said, and by noon had
arrived and moored off that uninteresting town. Coaling
at Port Said is effected with great rapidity, for ships have
to be speedily pushed on through the Canal to prevent a
block, thus, by the following afternoon, we commenced
our first stage of the Canal passage, under the escort of
one of the Company's steam tugs, for ships of our size
may not use their own engines for fear of the "wash"
abrading the sandy banks.</p>

<p>The character of the scenery soon changes, and we
seem to have an intuitive perception that we are in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>land of the Pharaohs. On the one side, far as the eye
can reach, and for hundreds of miles beyond, a desert of
glistening sand is spread before us, for the most part level
and unbroken, but occasionally interrupted by billow-like
undulations, resembling the ground swell at sea. Here
and there a salt pond breaks the monotonous ochre of
the sand. These ponds are, in the majority of cases,
quite dry, and encrusted with a beautiful crystalline
whiteness resembling snow, making even the desert look
interesting. On the Egyptian side, a series of gem-studded
lagoons stretch away to the haze of an indistinct
horizon, the mirage reproducing the green and gold of
the thousand isles in the highly heated atmosphere.</p>

<p>By 6 p.m. we had reached the first station, or "Gare,"
when we brought up alongside a jetty for the night.
When darkness had set in, the wild melancholy howl of
the jackal was borne across the desert by the evening
breeze, a sound sufficiently startling and inexplicable if
you don't happen to know its origin. What these animals
can find to eat in a parching desert is, and remains to me,
a mystery.</p>

<p>On pushing on the following morning, a quail and
several locusts flew on board; interesting because we are
now in the region of Scripture natural history. As I was
desirous of procuring a specimen of the Scriptural locust,
I expressed a wish to that effect, and soon had more of
them than I knew what to do with, till, in fact, I thought
the Egyptian plague was about to be exemplified. I will
here take occasion to thank my shipmates for their kindly
and ready assistance, in helping me to furnish a cabinet
with natural history specimens. Nothing living, coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>within their reach, has ever escaped them; birds, insects,
fish, reptiles, all have been laid as trophies before me to
undergo that metamorphosis known as "bottling." I
verily believe that had an elephant insinuated himself
across their path, he would have found his way into my
"preserves."</p>

<p>This was an extremely quiet day, everybody indulging a
siesta under double and curtained awnings, until about
5 p.m., when bump! a dead stop, and a list to port. We
are aground. But grounding on such a soft bed is not a
serious affair, and by extra exertions on the part of
"Robert," our tug, and a turn or two of our own screws,
we were soon in deep water again. This was but the
initiation ceremony; ere the termination of our commission
we were destined to become passed masters in the
art of bumping, as the sequel will show.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Canal ceases to be such, as
it enters that natural watercourse&mdash;the Bitter Lakes.
Herein, we are at perfect liberty to use our own engines,
whereby we are speedily across their glassy surface, and
entering on to the last portion of the passage. On
rounding a point on the opposite side, a scene, truly
Biblical, met our view&mdash;two Arab maidens tending their
flocks. Perhaps they had taken advantage of the absence
of man to uncover their faces; if so, they were speedily
careful to rectify the error, on catching sight of such
terrible beings as bluejackets; but not before we had
caught a glimpse at a rather pleasing face, with small,
straight nose, rosy lips, splendid teeth, the blackest of
eyes, and the brownest of skin. The veils, which serve to
hide their prettiness, are real works of art, composed of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>gold and silver coins, beads and shells, tastefully and
geometrically arranged on a groundwork of black lace.
After repeated hand kissing from our amorous tars&mdash;an
action whose significance is apparently lost on these
damsels&mdash;we bid good bye to the "nut-brown maids,"
and at 5 p.m., on September 4th, enter the broad waters
of the Gulf of Suez.</p>

<p>The great feature of the town of Suez is its donkeys;
wonderfully knowing creatures, who, with their masters,
look upon every visitor, as in duty bound, to engage their
services. To say them nay, and to suggest that your
legs are quite capable of bearing you to the town, is only
provocative of an incredulous smile, or a negative shake
of the head. Never was seen such patience and importunity
as that displayed by boy and beast. The most
striking thing about them is their names&mdash;shared in
common&mdash;which furnish one with a running commentary
on current events in Europe. For example, there were
the "Prince of Wales" and "Roger Tichborne," "Mrs.
Besant" and the "Fruits of Philosophy"! The
"mokes" are so well trained&mdash;or is it that they have
traversed the same ground so often? that, in spite of all
tugging at the reins, and the administration of thundering
applications of your heel in the abdominal region, they
will insist upon conducting you to a locality well understood,
but of no very pronounced respectability. I did
hear&mdash;but this between you and I&mdash;that a rather too
confiding naval chaplain, on one occasion, trusted himself
to the guidance of one of these perfidious beasts, and
even the sanctity of his cloth, could not save him from
the same fate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>September 7th. We may now be said to have entered
upon the saddest and most unpleasant part of the voyage,
that of the Red Sea passage.</p>

<p>The day after sailing, the look-out from the mast head
reported a vessel aground off the starboard bow, with a
second vessel close by, and, seemingly, in a similar predicament.
Our thoughts at once adverted to the two
troopships which left last night, so we hurried on, and,
arriving at the spot, found we had surmised correctly.
One only, the steamer, was aground; her consort, the
sailing ship, being at anchor a safe distance off. We lost
no time in sending hawsers on board, but it was not until
the third day that we were successful in our efforts to
haul her off.</p>

<p>Our voyage resumed, we had scarcely got out of sight
of the two ships, when the sudden cry of "man overboard!"
was heard above the din of flapping canvas and
creaking blocks. To stop the engines, gather in the upper
sails, let fly sheets, and back the main yard, was the work of
seconds; and before the ship was well around&mdash;smart as
she was on her heel, too&mdash;the life-boat was half-way on
her errand of mercy. Young Moxey was soon amongst
us again, none the worse for his involuntary immersion,
although his bath was more than an ordinary risky one,
owing to the proximity of sharks.</p>

<p>From that exalted observatory, the mast head, we
noticed the red colour from which the sea derives its
name. The surface has not a general ruddy tinge, as we
most of us thought it had,&mdash;only here and there blood-red
patches appear, mottling the vivid blue surface.</p>

<p>September 11th.&mdash;My "journal" is a blank for three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>whole days, owing to the intense heat, which is simply
unbearable. I can only give our friends a faint idea of
what it was like, by asking them to imagine themselves
strapped down over a heated oven whilst somebody has
built a fire on top of them, to ensure a judicious "browning"
on both sides alike. Sleep is out of the question,
"prickly heat" is careful of that. As may be supposed,
the sufferings of the deck hands&mdash;bad enough as in all
conscience it was&mdash;were not to be compared with the
tortures endured by the poor fellows in the stoke-hole,
who had to be hoisted up in buckets that they might gasp
in the scarcely less hot air on deck. From bad, this state
of things came to worse&mdash;men succumbed to its influence,
the sick list swelled, and, finally, death stalked insidiously
in our midst.</p>

<p>September 13th.&mdash;The first victim was John Bayley, a
marine, who died to-day after an illness of only a few
short hours. One curious thing about this sickness is
that those attacked by it exhibit, more or less, symptoms
of madness. One of my own messmates, for instance,
whose life was preserved by a miracle, almost went entirely
out of his mind. I will not dwell too long upon these
sufferings, nor rekindle the harrowing scenes in your
minds.</p>

<p>At sunset on the 14th the bell tolled for a funeral, as,
with half-masted flag, and officers and men assembled, we
prepared to do the last that ever poor Bayley would require
from man. Funerals are solemn things at any time, but a
funeral at sea is more than this&mdash;it is impressive and awe-inspiring,
especially if there be others so near death's
door that one does not know whose turn it may be next.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Decently and in order the hammock-clad form is brought
to the gangway, whilst the chaplain's voice, clear and
distinct&mdash;more distinct than ordinary it seems&mdash;reads the
beautiful service for the Church of England's dead. A
hollow plunge, a few eddying circles, at the words&mdash;"we
commit his body to the deep"&mdash;and he is gone for ever.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with departure of one, another
of our shipmates, Mr. Easton, the gunner, died.</p>

<p>Providentially for all of us, a squall of wind struck us
at this point of our voyage&mdash;a squall of such violence,
whilst it lasted, that the air was thoroughly purged of its
baneful qualities, and restored again to its elasticity.</p>

<p>But what a God-send it was! The iron hull of our
ship, always unpleasantly hot in these latitudes, was rapidly
cooled by the deluge of rain which came with the wind.
Renewed life and vigour entered into our emaciated
frames, and revivified men marked for death; and was it
not delicious to rush about naked in the puddles of rain
on the upper deck!</p>

<p>Well, all things mundane have an end, even the most
unpleasant&mdash;though it must be confessed their finality is
generally lingering. Thus our desolate voyage through
that seething cauldron, known to geographers and schoolboys
as the Red Sea, at length approached its termination.</p>

<p>Our grim shipmate, death, did not go over the side till
he had marked yet another victim for his insatiate grasp;
for, to-day, Mr. Scoble, one of our engineers, died. He,
too, was buried at sea, though we were only a few hours
from port. On the morn of this day, September 17th, we
passed the strait of Bab-el-mandeb&mdash;Arabic for "Gate of
Tears"&mdash;an extremely appropriate name, too, I should
think.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Aden, which we reached the same evening, has a very
bleak and barren appearance, and is, seemingly, nothing
better than a volcanic rock. Its apparent sterility does
not, as a matter of fact, exist; for it produces an abundance
of vegetables of all kinds, splendid corn with stalks above
the ordinary height, fruits, roses, and other delightful and
highly-scented flowers, in rank abundance. There is
something thriving and go-a-head about the place, in spite
of unkindly nature. It has one terrible drawback, for
rain falls only at intervals of years, sometimes taking a
holiday for three or even more years. The people are
busy and bustling&mdash;troops of camels, donkeys, and
ostriches continually stream in and out the town, testifying
to an extensive trade with the neighbouring states. A
peculiar race of people is found here, the Soumali&mdash;tall,
gaunt-looking fellows, with a mass of moppy hair dyed a
brilliant red. This head-gear, surmounting a small black
face, is laughable in the extreme. Plenty of ostrich
feathers may be obtained of the Arabian Jews; and
though, of course, you pay sailors' prices for them, yet
even then the sums given are not nearly so much as would
be charged in England for a far inferior feather.</p>

<p>On the eve of departure we were visited by a novel
shower, composed of sand and locusts, from the African
desert. These things, unpleasant as they seem to us, are,
we are told, of as common occurrence here as rain
showers at home.</p>

CRUISE IN THE STRAITS OF MALACCA.</p>


<p>September 21st.&mdash;Having, as it were, given the
go-by to two continents, we commence on an
extended acquaintance with a third.</p>

<p>With sails spread to a S.W. monsoon we rapidly speed
over that glorious expanse of luminous sea where it is ever
summer, and in whose pearly depths living things innumerable
revel in the very joy of existence.</p>

<p>Though hot, this part of the voyage is not unpleasant,
for a cooling breeze is constantly setting down the hatchways
from the sails. What one would rather be without,
though, is that tropical tinting known as the "prickly
heat," which now begins to get troublesome; for, like
boils, its spots generally select those parts of the epidermis
where they are likely to become of the greatest nuisance,
making the friction of garments almost intolerable; but
there, one can't have everything.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>When the sails are trimmed with the same regularity
day after day, with never a tack nor sheet started, existence
does not offer much of variety, so that, like Columbus'
sailors, we were glad to welcome even a gale of wind.
Now, a rolling and pitching ship is capital fun if you can
manage to stay the surgings of a revolutionary stomach;
but it sometimes happens that you can't, when, to vary a
line in "In Memoriam," "you heave responsive to the
heaving deep." Then, too, we are as hungry as "sea
dogs." Ten or twelve days on sea rations are not to be
envied, especially as there is plenty of room for improvement
in the dietary. It is all very nice, nay, pleasant
even, to feel hungry when there is a prospect of a good
"feed" in the tin dish; but how frequently do we find a
"southerly wind" prevailing in that receptacle for
"panem;" and what is there, I ask, in "Fanny Adams"
alternated with "salt junk?" In the one, nausea; in the
other, mahogany.</p>

<p>Friday, October 14th.&mdash;Just at our breakfast hour we
sighted that oriental fairy garden, Ceylon's isle; and
though we must be from fifteen to twenty miles off, a
curiously-constructed native vessel, with perhaps a dozen
persons on board, has just put out to welcome and pilot
us to land. A boat so different to all other boats that I
must say a word about it. It is a sort of double canoe,
constructed of the hollowed out trunk of a cocoanut
tree, to which is attached a couple of outriggers, with a
second canoe-shaped structure at their extremities, but of
lesser dimensions than the boat proper, and differing from
it, too, in not being hollowed out&mdash;in fact the latter is
used only as a balance for the other. When it comes on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>to blow with any force, the Singalese boatmen may be
observed standing out on their outriggers, to counteract
the force of the wind on the high sails. The stronger the
breeze the further out the men go. Their mode of
expressing the intensity of a breeze is significant. The
Singalese don't say as we do, it is blowing stiff, or half a
gale, or a gale; but that it is a "one-man wind," or
"two," or "three-man wind," as the case may be. I
believe a similar idiom is used by the natives of the
Sandwich isles.</p>

<p>On nearing the land we could see how really delightful
this ocean gem is. One mass of gorgeous, perfumed
foliage blazes suddenly on the sight from the midst of the
sea; feathery palms, broad trembling leaves, and groves
of lofty cocoanut trees springing from the midst of richly-flowering
shrubs.</p>

<p>From the inner harbour the view of Galle is very fine.
For miles on either hand stretches a palm-fringed shore,
with the noble cocoanut trees so close to the water's
edge, that at times the sea seems to dash right into their
midst. Cocoanut trees, like volcanoes, seemingly prefer
the proximity of the sea to a more retired position.</p>

<p>The whole scene reminds one of the beautiful places
visited by captain Cook, in his voyages. Even the boats
are laden with the self-same royal fruits&mdash;great green
cocoanuts, pine apples, bananas, plantains, and yams.</p>

<p>All those curiosities for which India is famous&mdash;every
conceivable article which the fancy or ingenuity of man
can possibly fabricate out of such commodities, as sandal
wood, ebony, ivory, and porcupines' quills, richly and
delicately carved, may be had here for a mere song if you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>possess only patience. Amongst other things there is a
brisk trade carried on in precious stones. Some of the
dealers in this article have found their way to our lower
deck, and proceed to pull little parcels, containing sparkling
and pellucid gems from their inner garments. There,
before us, in their downy nest, lie rubies, sapphires, opals,
and many more real or fictitious stones, seven-eighths of
which are probably manufactured at Birmingham, though
Ceylon abounds in real gems. It may, I think, be safely
conceded that "Jack" very rarely drops in for one such.
The dealers ask most fabulous prices for their wares&mdash;so
many thousand rupees; but after haggling with you for
about an hour or so are glad enough to part with them at
your own price&mdash;a proof, should you need it, of the
<i>genuineness</i> of your purchase.</p>

<p>We are rather dubious at first about entering the canoes,
for they are so narrow as scarcely to admit of our broad
hams being comfortably stowed. However, by dint of a
little lateral pressure in that quarter, we at length manage
to wedge ourselves in. We find the motion pleasant
enough&mdash;a sense of security growing with experience.</p>

<p>I suppose we are not the first, nor, unless some sudden
calamity undertake the place, are we likely to be the last,
who have remarked how exceeding annoying the "boys"
at the landing-place are. Guides they call themselves;
sailors, in their excellently-terse and rotund way, call them
by another name, which certainly does not commence with
a "G." These wasps know just sufficient of English to
make you disgusted with your mother tongue. The
ordinary and generally conclusive argument of applying
the toe of one's boot to the region of their quarter galleries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>does not seem to be effective here. It is one of those
things one has to put up with.</p>

<p>The town follows the sinuous windings of the shore for
upwards of a mile and a half, under an arcade of cocoa
palms, which forms one of the finest promenades imaginable.
Under this quivering canopy the fierce rays of the
outside sun filter through&mdash;a soft, sheeny, mellow light&mdash;making
his tropic rays deliciously cool, at the same time
imparting to them a mystic coloring of gold and emerald
green in all their wonderful combinations and capabilities
of tone, impossible to set down in writing.</p>

<p>A noticeable thing about all this wonderful profusion, is
the number of beautiful shrubs, principally spice or perfume
bearing, and the grand harmonies and contrasts of
colour they present. Here, for example, is the nutmeg,
with its peach-like fruit; here the cinnamon, a tree whose
foliage embraces the most delicate gradations of colour,
from olive green to softest pink; there an aromatic gum
tree, the dark-leaved coffee tree, the invaluable bread fruit,
and scores of others beyond my botanical ken.</p>

<p>The houses, examined in detail, are not by any means
the captivating objects we took them to be from the ship;
and they certainly don't improve on a closer acquaintance.
The air in the vicinity is thick and heavy, with a rancid
odour of cocoanut oil, emanating from the hair and bodies
of the local humanity. Their dwellings are constructed
of humble enough materials, in all conscience; for of the
four sides, three are of mud, the fourth being left open for
the purposes usually supplied by doors, windows, and
chimneys amongst ourselves. A sort of blind of cocoanut-fibre
covers this aperture to about half way, so that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>one can easily see what is going on within. Near the door
reclines an indolent, almost nude man, in the most convenient
attitude for sleep; in the far corner his wife or
slave&mdash;for the names are synonymous&mdash;toiling and moiling
at a stone mill&mdash;a gaunt, angular, ugly woman, with
great rings in her nose and ears, and on her wrists and
ankles. Perfectly nude children and mangy-looking curs have
all the rest of the apartment to themselves; and from
the way in which they are enjoying their gambols, one may
judge that for them life is not an unpleasant thing on the
whole. The number of brown imps scattered about the
streets, threatening to upset your every movement, speaks
highly of the prolificness of Singalese matrons; and if a
numerous progeny is a desirable thing, then these mammas
ought to consider themselves blessed amongst women.
Their general aspect, though, conveys the opposite
impression.</p>

<p>Everybody is addicted to the vice of chewing the betel-nut,
a proceeding which has the effect of dyeing the teeth
and lips a brilliant crimson, and gives to this people the
appearance of an universal bleeding at the mouth.</p>

<p>Having completed a hasty perambulation of the town
we drive boldly into the undergrowth to where a strange-looking
building lies half-buried in the foliage. It proves
to be a Buddhist temple, an octagonal-shaped structure
with a bell-like roof. As we enter within its precincts, boy
priests are particularly careful to obliterate the marks of
our <i>heathen</i> feet on their beautiful floor of golden sand.
Inside are eight figures of the good Buddha, alternately
standing and sitting, depicted with that calm, inscrutable
countenance so remarkable in the image of this deity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>wherever this religion prevails. Before each figure is a
small altar, littered with flowers, the most conspicuous
blossom being the lotus lily, the symbol of this faith.
Other than these devotional oblations there is little to be
seen; what part in the ceremonies the priests take, or
where they perform their functions, does not appear.</p>

<p>At the gate of the Court on our passing out, stands a
bold, yellow-robed priest, with a metal salver in his hand,
suggestive of donations. We told the old gent with naval
bluntness that we were not in the habit of aiding the
Society for the propagation of paganism&mdash;a remark, by the
way, which it was as well, perhaps, he could not understand.</p>

<p>Sunday, October 6th.&mdash;Though sailors are excellent
singers&mdash;especially of hymn tunes&mdash;I never before heard
a hymn rendered so effectively on board a man-of-war
as that beautiful composition by Bishop Heber, commencing</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">"What though the spicy breezes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and which was one of the appropriate hymns for our
morning Service.</p>

<p>October 8th.&mdash;Towards evening we bade good-bye to
this favoured land, and stood away to the eastward. We
had made good an offing, and set everything aloft snug
for the night, when heavy volumes of steam were found to
be issuing from the regions of the engine-room. A steam
pipe had burst, a fracture of so little moment that after a
short delay to effect repairs we were able to resume our
voyage. But though the damage was not serious, so far
as the ship was concerned, to us, personally, it was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>matter of some consequence, on account of our bags and
chests being stowed immediately over the fractured pipe;
and in order to secure our property, we were compelled
to make a blind rush for it, re-appearing from our vapour
bath, as red as boiled lobsters.</p>

<p>A splendid eight knot breeze brought us, after a few
days, off Acheen head, in Sumatra, and at the entrance of
the Straits of Malacca. And here, the monsoon which
had favoured us over so many miles of the pathless
ocean, suddenly forsook us. Sails were of no further use,
and we braced up our sweat glands for four or five days
of increasing heat. In obedience to the demands of an
imperious, ever-rising, thermometer, we reduced our rig
to the least possible articles consistent with decency and
the regulations of the Service&mdash;which latter, by the way,
discriminates not between the caloric of the north pole
and that of the equator.</p>

<p>Just at this time, we encountered a phenomenon of
frequent occurrence in this region, namely, water-spouts.
One of these tremendous, funnel-shaped, columns of
water actually burst just ahead of us, drenching our
decks in showers of spray, and causing the water to
seethe and vex itself as though some monster were lashing
it into fury.</p>

<p>October 18th.&mdash;The scene which presented itself to our
eyes, as we entered the narrow, gem-studded channel
which leads up to Singapore was such that I trust it may
live long in my mind as a memory picture of grateful and
refreshing beauty. I don't know that it will compare with
the mighty growth of Ceylon's forests, or with the variety
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>and richness of its forms; but for mellowness of tint and
harmonious blending of soft foliage, Singapore's park-like
views seem to me, as yet, unrivalled. The channel is so
narrow and its banks so high, that one is quite unprepared
for the splendour which suddenly, like the shifting
lights in a transformation scene, blazes out in all its
tropic splendour. <i>Now</i>, the scenes depicted in the
"Arabian Nights" seem to me not so impossible after all,
and, except that gems don't grow on the trees, this fairy
garden might well have stood in the writer's mind as his
ideal of paradise.</p>

<p>Very reluctantly we turn away, as that grim reality,
known as the Tangong Pagar coaling wharf, heaves in
sight, and alongside which we are rapidly secured. Hundreds
of coolies, in anticipation of our enormous wants&mdash;500 tons
of carbon&mdash;are already thronging the jetty with
their baskets of coal, which ere long, is rattling down our
coal shoots.</p>

<p>The Malays, though labouring under the disadvantage
of a bad reputation, are a well developed, muscular race,
of a dark, copper colour. Dress does not trouble them
much, for all that custom and society demand of them in
this respect is a couple of yards or so of white linen
about their lumbar region; the remainder of their
sleek, oily bodies presenting the appearance of polished
bronze. They are great divers, especially the youths
and boys&mdash;I had almost said <i>infants</i>, for some of the
little mortals can scarcely have passed the sucking age.
Their stock of English is very limited: "Jack, I say jack,
I dive," delivered all in one mouthful and with no regard
to punctuation, being about the extent of their acquirements
in our tongue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Our first day at Singapore was marked by a sad termination.
Emanuel Dewdney, one of our boys, a weakly
lad and far too delicate for the rough life he had adopted,
died of heat apoplexy in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Though Singapore lies so near the equator&mdash;within
two degrees of it in fact&mdash;it enjoys a very healthy, though,
of course, a very hot climate. The town itself is not very
extensive. There is the usual native Malay division with
its system of mud architecture, its dirt and smells; and
that of the European residents&mdash;a marked contrast to the
irregular jumble of the other. I don't know that there is
particularly much to see in the island, except, perhaps,
the Botanical Gardens, whose beauties will amply repay
you for the rather long walk to reach them. You may
take a coach if you like, but that will spoil the pleasure.
In these gardens all the choicest and rarest flora, and
much of the fauna, of the East Indies, are brought
together and acclimatized. The most conspicuous
amongst the former, and certainly the most lovely&mdash;and
that is saying much where all excel&mdash;is a species of
acacia, a large tree with great flaming scarlet and yellow
flowers. Then there is that extremely interesting and
singularly funny creeper, the sensitive plant, which, on
the approach of anybody, has the power of doubling up
its leaves as if in sudden fear. Birds in great variety&mdash;all
scarlet, gold, and azure&mdash;inhabit spacious aviaries within
the grounds. Lyre birds, argus pheasants, great eagles,
and owls from Java, doves, pigeons, lories, and humming
birds, the metallic lustre of whose plumage flashes in the
light like the sheen of steel. One or two tigers&mdash;in a
cage, of course&mdash;invite our curiosity. I was not, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>prepared to make quite so close an acquaintance with
these lovely supple creatures, as one of the marines of
our party, who, having indulged too freely in malt,
possibly mistook the animals for cats, the result being he
got so damaged about the bows as to be rendered unfit
for divisions the following morning, and barely escaped
with his eyesight. Drink makes a man do queer things.</p>

<p>The native men are very picturesquely apparelled in
gaily coloured turbans and sarongs, whilst the women,&mdash;tall,
graceful, and pretty&mdash;convey a small fortune
about with them, in the shape of jewellery, in the cartilage
of the nose, in the ears, and around the arms and
legs. I saw one woman who had such heavy masses of
gold in her ears that the lobes of those organs touched
her shoulders.</p>

<p>November 1st.&mdash;At 9 a.m. the long-expected "Audacious"
hove in sight, flying the flag of Admiral Hillyar at the
main. How we already envy her fortunate crew!</p>

<p>November 8th, off to Penang. The pipe "up anchor"
this morning was hailed with delight. Anything to
change the dull monotony of the last few weeks. We
started with an overcast and rainy sky, and by the next
morning had reached Malacca, a small British settlement,
essentially Malay, more a village than a town. It lies
very low and close to the water's edge, the houses of the
natives being all constructed on piles driven into the
mud, and embowered in a dense framework of cocoa
palms. In the distance rises the high cone-shaped peak
of Ophir, now a lovely sight because of the misty covering
which envelopes it to near its summit. Bananas are
very plentiful; so, too, are monkeys and the canes so
highly prized at home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>November 9th.&mdash;To-day, our own admiral came in, in
the mail steamer, and glad are we that he has arrived,
that we may be again on the move, for you know there
are happier states and more comfortable, than a forcible
detention in a red-hot ironclad.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 13th.&mdash;I see in my "journal" that I
have noted what, under ordinary conditions, would call
for no remark, that a lady was present at our service to-day.
None but those who are banished the softening
and refreshing influence of woman's society can form any
idea how pleasant it is to see an English woman in this
land of yellow bellies and sable skins.</p>

<p>November 15th.&mdash;Now we are really the Flag Ship, for
this morning the "Audacious," with a parting cheer,
bade us good-bye, and started for home.</p>

<p>November 21st.&mdash;By early morning we discovered the
island of Din Ding right a-head.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the wonderful beauty of this tiny
island. From the sea it has so much the appearance of the
bosky slopes of Mount Edgcumbe, that, were it not for
the characteristic palm, one could well imagine one's self
looking at a bit of our own dear England.</p>

<p>A stretch of sandy beach, white and glistening as silver,
with the graceful waving plumes of the cocoanut tree close
to the water's edge, and behind, the pile dwellings of the
Malays, nestling at the foot of a wooded eminence, capped
to its very summit with a dense and varied growth; such
is the picture viewed from the anchorage. Din Ding, or
Ding Ding&mdash;as sailors, by a system of alliteration, very
fashionable amongst themselves&mdash;render it, lies at the
mouth of the Perak river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>On landing we struck at once into the jungle, under tall
palms, with their great ripening fruit, and other tropic
vegetation. Road, there was none; only a sort of bridle
path, very heavy with mud, and overgrown with great
hawser-like creepers, indicated a way along which we
trudged. Now and then the fallen trunk of a great tree
barred our further progress, or a chasm yawned before us,
or mayhap, a great time-worn boulder stopped the way;
insignificant objects all when matel&ocirc;ts are on the war trail.
Our object was to reach a certain house on yonder point,
in which a most dastardly murder was recently perpetrated
on the British resident, Colonel Lloyd, who, with his wife
and sister, had made this their home. The house is now
quite empty, but in one of the rooms we saw, or fancied
we saw, spots of sanguine dye on the floor.</p>

<p>We hastened onward through a small hamlet of about
a dozen miserable huts, resting on piles. Tubs of putrid
fish, in all stages of decomposition, gave out a most horrid
stench, whilst other carcasses strewed the ground in advanced
rottenness. Is it not revolting, that amongst these
people, fish in its pure state is rarely eaten, and if it be, it
is always raw. But nature is ever lovely, though the
human part of her does all it can to deface her; if she
were not so what a spoiled world ours would be!</p>

<p>Holding our nostrils we ran for it, doubtful if we should
ever get rid of the smell. Further on was a hut of rather
larger pretensions, now used as a barrack for the police.
One of these latter, who possessed a tolerable knowledge of
English, struck up a conversation with us, and amongst
indifferent topics we asked about the prisoners recently
captured. He certainly took us by surprise, when he indicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
they were within the building, alongside of which we
were standing. Would we like to see them? We would.
Yes, true enough, there on the floor were five Chinamen,
lashed and bound so tight that the flesh stood out in
great purple ridges on either side the rope.</p>

<p>To get back to our boat we had to repass the village of
odours delectable. On this occasion the scantily clad
and polished Malays, whom we had not seen on passing
through, put in an appearance.</p>

<p>By 4 p.m. the anchor was aweigh, and we heading towards
Penang, which was reached on the following day in
the midst of thick, dirty weather.</p>

<p>The town is well built, and the cleanest I have yet seen
since leaving Europe. The island is sometimes termed
the "Garden of the East," and if it is always as now, I
should say the name was justly bestowed. A little way
out in the country is a fine waterfall, which all who call
here, make a point of visiting. Jumping into a pony
carriage, locally called a <i>gharry</i>, a comfortable, well
ventilated vehicle, capable of seating four persons, we desire
the turban driver to steer for the latter place. Along
the very fine road to the fall, a profusion of palms and
gigantic tree ferns, between thirty and forty feet high, up
whose great stems gaily flowered creepers wind their
hawser-like fronds, make a delicious and cooling shade.
Yonder tree away there in the background, with delicate
pea-green leaves, is an old friend of ours. Let your
memories go back to your infancy. Cannot you recall
many a wry face; cannot you remember how unpleasant
the after sensations when stern, but kind mothers forced a
nauseous decoction called "senna" down your widely-gaping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
throat? You smile. I felt certain you had all
experienced it. Well that is the senna tree.</p>

<p>Large mansions lying back from the roadway, with
gates and paths leading up to their entrances, and a smell
of new mown hay, were most home-like and refreshing.</p>

<p>We should have fared much better had a more mutual
understanding existed between us and our pony. That
obtuse little beast, good enough at curves and tangents,
after half an hour's canter, flatly refused to exert himself
above a walk; nor, though frequently encouraged by the
whip, did he accelerate his movements to the end of our
drive.</p>

<p>At the fall we had a very refreshing shower bath under a
thundering cascade of water tumbling over the edge of a
gorge. Near at hand, and conveniently so, too, for the
priesthood, is a small shrine sacred to the Hindoo god
Brahin, a diminutive edition of whom stands on a little
pedestal, amidst braziers, lamps, figures with elephants'
heads and human bodies, and other monstrosities. You
may be certain there was a mendicant priest in attendance
on his godship.</p>

<p>On the return voyage our hack behaved even more ungentlemanly
than before, for now he most emphatically
refused to budge an inch, indicating his intention of
becoming a fixture by planting his feet obliquely, like a
stubborn jackass, into the ground. Human nature could
scarcely be expected to tolerate such evidence of mutiny,
so, jumping into the first passing carriage, we reached the
town at a fairly creditable canter.</p>

<p>November 28th.&mdash;To-day our short stay at Penang
comes to a conclusion, and a few days afterwards we are
once more at Singapore.</p>

<p class="summary">SARAWAK.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;LABUAN.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;MANILLA.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;HEAVY WEATHER.</p>


<p>December 5th.&mdash;At 4 p.m. the anchor was hove
short for our voyage to Hong Kong, by way
of Manilla. As we start some days sooner
than we anticipated, we had made no provision
for getting our washed clothes on board, and grave
fears are entertained that we shall be compelled to
sail without it, for as yet there is not so much as the ghost
of a washerwoman in sight. Will they, can they by any
fortuitous combination of circumstances, put in an appearance
before we leave? Despair, we are off! But
surely no, it can't be? Yes, by jove, there are boats pulling
after us with all the might the rowers can command.
We lie to, the proas come nearer. Hurrah! the clothes,
some wholly washed, some half-washed, and some not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>washed at all. Piles of fair white linen are bundled up the
gangway pell-mell, Malay washerwomen bundled <i>out</i> ditto,
and for payment, the revolving screws settle that in a
highly satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>With the "Lapwing" in tow, and the gentlest of
breezes filling the lighter canvas, we shape our course
eastward.</p>

<p>December 8th.&mdash;Late in the afternoon we brought up
in the roadstead of Sarawak, on the northern coast of
Borneo. The place is not at all enlivening; neither
house, human being, nor boat, to indicate we are in
habitable land. The town itself, the capital of a small
rajahship governed by an Englishman, lies some twenty
miles up a river, in the estuary of which we are anchored.
The province was presented by the Sultan of Borneo, in
1843, to Sir James Brooke, uncle of the present proprietor,
who, on the decease of Sir James, in 1868, succeeded
to the territory.</p>

<p>Here the "Lapwing," after having taken the admiral
up the river, parted company, whilst we continued our
way along the Bornean shore.</p>

<p>December 12th.&mdash;We awoke to find ourselves in the
midst of a labyrinth of isles most wonderful to behold,
vaguely guessing which, out of so many, can be Labuan.
The rattling of the chain through the hawse, decides it.
A small settlement over which England's flag keeps guard,
lies before us. This is the town of Victoria. This small
island, previous to 1846, belonged to Borneo, but in that
year the Sultan ceded it to Britain, as a convenient
station for checking piracy on his sea-board. It lies off
the north-eastern end of the great island of Borneo, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>within view of its precipitous heights and mist-clad peaks.</p>

<p>December 14th.&mdash;Coaling is a long process at Labuan,
first, because the ship lies so far from the shore, and next,
because of the insufficiency of convenient boats, and the
necessary coolie labour to put the coal on board, thus
it took us two whole days to get in as many hundred tons.
By the evening of the 14th however, we had cleared the
islands, and shaped course for Manilla against a head
wind.</p>

<p>December 19th.&mdash;It has taken us twelve hours to clear
the intricate, and gusty approaches to Manilla Bay, the
wind, occasionally meeting us with such force, accompanied
by such a chopping sea, that we sometimes made
no progress at all. On coming to anchor we were rather
surprised to find the "Lapwing" had preceded us, and
was lying close in shore.</p>

<p>Manilla, the capital of Luzon, the largest of the Philippine
Islands, is a city of considerable magnitude, and has
all the appearance of a Spanish town in Europe, these
islands having belonged to Spain for over 300 years.</p>

<p>Though we arrived on a Sunday it was anticipated there
would be no difficulty in procuring coal immediately.
Had the British been in authority here we should have
been <i>privileged</i> to do so with impunity. When this conclusion
was arrived at, one potent factor had not been
considered&mdash;"the Church"&mdash;and for once in a way we
were thankful to the Church. The archbishop of Manilla
and his subordinates hold more real sway over the minds
and bodies of the natives&mdash;Indians, as they are called&mdash;than
all the temporal power of the governor, backed by
his guards, or even than the king himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Amidst all the Spanish jabber around, it is refreshing to
hear ourselves hailed in genuine English, and soon the
author of the sound grasps us by the hand and welcomes
us to his house, a request we gladly comply with.</p>

<p>The houses are very like those of Gibraltar, and one's
memory is rapidly borne back to the "Rock," especially
as everything around is Spanish.</p>

<p>Perhaps the great feature of the place is its cathedrals;
one in particular, a magnificent structure, so roomy and
lofty that I should think half the devout of the city could
find accommodation therein. In less than two years
subsequent to our visit the whole of this grand pile was
little better than a heap of ruins, from an earthquake wave
which passed over these islands. This most terrible of
natural phenomena is of frequent occurrence in this
quarter of the world. In many parts of the city we
observed whole streets and churches in ruins, as if from a
recent bombardment.</p>

<p>Cock-fighting is the great national sport, amusement, or
cruelty, which of the three you will, indulged in by the
good people of Manilla. Everywhere along the streets
you may meet Spanish boys and half castes, with each his
bird tucked under his arm ready for the combat, should
the chance passer-by make it worth their while.</p>

<p>The best place to witness this propensity for blood,
which seems in-born in every Spaniard, is at the public
arena in the heart of the city, where hundreds of cocks
are generally engaged at once, the betting on a certain
bird not unfrequently amounting to thousands of dollars.
I will not trouble you with the sickening details of the scene
I witnessed&mdash;to my shame I say it&mdash;I think few of those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>who are present at a first exhibition of this cruel and
useless sport will be desirous of witnessing a second&mdash;except
he be a man of a morbid inclination. One may be
impelled by curiosity to satisfy a human weakness, but
every rightly balanced mind will turn from the scene with
feelings of repugnance and disgust.</p>

<p>December 23rd.&mdash;The last day of our stay, and the last
opportunity we shall have for laying in stock for the 25th.
In the afternoon the caterers of messes having been
accorded the necessary permission, went on shore to make
a general clearance in the Manilla markets. There was
every prospect, when they left the ship, of the day continuing
fine&mdash;a bright sun and a clear sky above, and a
smooth sea below. Unfortunately for the success of the
expedition, this happy meteoric combination did not
continue. The heavens began to frown, and the sea&mdash;ever
jealous of its sister's moods&mdash;put on a restless appearance.
At sun-down the wind suddenly rose to half a gale,
with a cross lumpy sea and drenching showers of rain.
The accommodation for the men to return to the ship was
degrees from being called even fair. They had hired a
rickety steam launch, scarcely capable of holding her own
in ordinary weather, and two smaller boats, or gigs, neither
of which was in a seaworthy condition; and in these was
to be found room for upwards of forty men, besides about
a ton of provisions of all kinds. It was evident, or ought
to have been, that it was madness to attempt leaving the
shore whilst the present weather lasted. I have seen the
offence of breaking leave justified for less boisterous
weather. Orders, however, (especially sailing orders) are
imperative; so the flotilla put off at 7 p.m. in tow of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>launch. The following was the arrangement:&mdash;The
launch, laden far below her bearings, took the lead; the
second boat contained all the heaviest provisions&mdash;flour,
pigs, poultry, potatoes, and such like; whilst far too many
men had stowed themselves in the third boat, to give but
the faintest idea of either comfort or safety.</p>

<p>When about half-way to the ship, the painter of the
hindmost boat parted, and the launch, rounding to, to her
assistance narrowly escaped swamping. The next mishap
chanced to the second boat&mdash;the provision gig&mdash;whose
stem piece was tugged completely out of her, and the two
sides, having thus lost their mutual support, parted and
went to the bottom, the onlookers having to endure the
melancholy sight of witnessing all their good things going
to fatten old Davy Jones, or to fill his lockers, or something
of that sort. But the distress of these very distressed
mariners was not yet complete; a strange fatality seemed
to have embarked with them. It was now the launch's
turn: first the third boat, next the second, and now the
launch in proper, though fortunately not arithmetical
progression. It was discovered that the supply of coal
could not possibly last to the ship! What was to be
done? "Opportunity," it is said, "makes the thief;"
it may be also said, with equal truth, that opportunity
makes the dormant abilities of some men to soar above
their fellows, over-riding even destiny itself. The Spanish
crew of the launch were unequal to the emergency, were
worse than useless in fact; but an able substitute for the
engineer was found in Andrews, one of our leading stokers;
and for coxswain, who better than Law, the boatswain's
mate? The former of these at once directed everybody
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>to pull the inner wood work of the launch to pieces, and,
as the bump of destructiveness has its full development in
the sailor phrenology, he had not long to wait for his fuel;
thus they managed to reach the ship full six hours after
they had left the shore.</p>

<p>December 25th.&mdash;Christmas in merry England is one
thing; Christmas in a gale in the China Sea another, and
so distinct a thing as scarcely to be confounded with the
former. But let us see if we can tell our friends something
about it. Considering the shortcomings we had to put
up with&mdash;bare tables, hungry bellies, and the lively movements
of our ship, consequent on a rising malevolent sea&mdash;I think
we managed to enjoy a fair amount of fun, whether
it was genuine or not is another point, nor would I like to
vouch for its being altogether devoid of irony. "Father
Christmas" paid us his customary visit anyway, in his
mantle of snow&mdash;fancy snow within fifteen degrees of the
line!&mdash;which merry, rubicund, and very ancient man was
ably personated by a gigantic marine, the necessary barrel-like
proportions being conveyed by a feather pillow.</p>

<p>"A hungry man is an angry one;" so runs the legend,
but, if true, and I have every reason to believe that it is,
it held not on the lower deck of the "Iron Duke" this day,
for <i>no</i> man was angry, and <i>every</i> man <i>was</i> hungry, not
counting some who had their heads down the lee scuppers.
Altogether the day passed very smoothly inboard, though
outside a storm was hurrying on us with gigantic strides.</p>

<p>December 26th.&mdash;The overcast sky of last night was
indeed a precursor of what was to follow. About midnight
the wind freshened into a full gale, the first we have
encountered since leaving England. It gave us a proper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>shaking down into our places. The sea became wild and
mountainous, the wind shrieking and vicious, and as to
hold our course we had to stem its full fury, it was found
impossible to keep the ship head on except at a much
greater consumption of coal than we were prepared to use.
Crash! What's gone? The jib-boom and all its appurtenances.
The wrecked spar falling athwart the ram
remained there for hours, proving a most difficult obstacle
to clear away in such a whirl as was going on in the
neighbourhood of our bows.</p>

<p>But there were no signs of the gale moderating, and the
admiral deeming, I suppose, the present state of things
far from satisfactory determined on putting back to
Manilla. The ship was brought around, or "wore" as
nautical men term it, an evolution which, though not of
difficult accomplishment, at a certain moment in its
progress leaves the vessel completely helpless in the trough
of the sea, a fact you all know far better than myself, I
only touch upon it to hint what the result must be to such
a cumbersome mass as our iron hull. As we broached to,
it became a matter of holding on to everything, and by
everything&mdash;eyebrows and all&mdash;especially between decks.
Delightful times these for ditty boxes, crockery, bread
barges, and slush tubs; 'tis their only chance for enjoyment
and they make the most of it. Such revelry generally
winds up with a grand crash somewhere in the vicinity of
the iron combings to the hatchways. Any plates left, any
basins? Nay, that would be to ask too much of the
potter's art. At length we are put round, and running
back to Manilla under all the canvas we dare shew.</p>

<p>December 31st.&mdash;Completed with coal and left on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>fresh attempt to reach Hong Kong, the black and lowering
sky suggesting either the continuation of, or the sequel to,
the late stormy weather. Being New Year's Eve the usual
attempt at a tin-pot band was made to make the night
hideous. Setting aside the annoyance of this species of
rowdyism to the less exuberant spirits amongst us, the
noise would be most unseemly with the commander-in-chief
on board, and it says much for the would-be
musicians that they saw it in this light.</p>

<p>We reached the northern point of Luzon without
mishap, and stood away with a heavy cross-sea for Hong
Kong, arriving on January 4th, 1879.</p>

<p class="summary">HONG KONG.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;SOME CHINESE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.</p>


<p>I suppose there are few amongst us, sailors though
we are, who, as boys at school when reading of China,
have never expressed a wish to see that land for
themselves, to say nothing of making the acquaintance of
its quaint old-world people in their very own homes. In
my imagination I had covered its goodly soil with
wondrous palaces, all sparkling with splendour and
embellished with all that art could furnish or riches
command. I had peopled its broad plains with bright
beautiful forms in silken attire, amongst whom a love of
the elegant and the beautiful pervaded all classes of the
community, and who in long ages ago had attained to arts
and learning which it has taken us centuries of careful
study and elaborate research to acquire. Yea, it was
always a wonderland to me, even down to the present
year; such is the power which the associations formed by
the child exercise over the mind of the man. Yet were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>we prepared to meet a people who should, in almost all
things, differ from almost all other peoples. In the last
particular we are not deceived; in all else, yes. But I
wont anticipate.</p>

<p>In this little book I shall not be able to tell you a tithe
of what may be told of this land did I feel competent to
do so. Volumes have been written on the subject, and
still the half has not been said. I purpose, therefore,
henceforward to intersperse with the narrative of our own
doings, just so much of the manners and customs of the
Chinese and Japanese, as every sailor possessed of the
ordinary powers of vision may see for himself.</p>

<p>January 4th.&mdash;The harbour of Hong Kong is reached
from the sea by means of a rather long and tortuous passage,
with bleak barren heights on either hand,&mdash;the
channel being in some parts so narrow that there is scarce
room for the ship to turn.</p>

<p>The island itself&mdash;rendered either "<i>red harbour</i>" or
"<i>fragrant streams</i>," which you prefer, though neither
seems applicable, certainly not the latter if by <i>fragrance</i>
is meant what we mean by it&mdash;lies on the southern seaboard
of China. It became British in 1842, on the conclusion
of the first Chinese war. The city of Victoria is
situated on its northern side, and stands on a beautiful
land-locked harbour, formed by the island on the one hand
and the peninsula of Kowloon (also British) on the other
a sheet of water which always presents a gay and animated
appearance, from the thousands of vessels and boats which
cover its surface like a mosaic.</p>

<p>It is not without some difficulty that we push our way
through the thronging craft, principally little boats termed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>"sampans," to our moorings abreast of the Dockyard.
Curious craft withal, and serving a double purpose; for
besides their legitimate one, whole families live and move,
are born, and die in them; the necessary accommodation
being furnished by an ingenious arrangement of hatches,
floors, and partitions, and, as it seems highly fashionable
that the Chinese mammas should be making constant
additions to the population, the squalling of the young
celestials betrays a healthiness of lung, and a knowledge
of its capabilities, scarcely to be credited of such small
humanity.</p>

<p>The earlier fate of these infantile members of the boat
population is sad. They are exposed to a "rough-and-tumble"
existence as soon as they are ushered into the
world, especially should the poor innocent have the
misfortune to be born a girl baby, for in that case she has
simply to shift for herself, the inhuman parents considering
themselves fortunate if they lose a girl or two overboard.
The boys, or "bull" children, as they are termed, meet
with rather more care relatively speaking. As, from the
nature of their occupation, but little time can be devoted
to nursing&mdash;the mother being compelled to constant
labour at the oar&mdash;the child is slung on to her back, and,
as she moves to and fro with the stroke of the oar, the
babe's soft face bobs in unison against its mother's back, a
fact which will perhaps explain how it is that the lower
class Chinese wear their noses flattened out on their two
cheeks rather than in the prominent position usually
selected by that organ.</p>

<p>It is amazing how wonderfully quick the Chinese pick
up a colloquial foreign tongue; the same tailor for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>instance experiencing no difficulty in making himself
understood in English, French, Russian, or Spanish;
English, though, is the language par excellence along all
the China seaboard. So universal is it that a foreigner
must needs know something of our tongue to make
himself intelligible to the ordinary Chinaman; and, more
remarkable still, there is such a vast difference between
the spoken dialects of north and south China&mdash;nay, even
between any two provinces in the "Flowery Land"&mdash;that
I have known some of our native domestics from the
Canton district, when talking with their countrymen of
Chefoo, communicate their ideas and wants in English,
because their own medium failed them; the difference
between the native dialects being as broad as that between
English and Dutch.</p>

<p>Though such a diversity exists <i>orally</i>, the <i>written</i>
character is common, and expresses exactly the same idea
all over the empire, and beyond it in Japan, Corea, and
the Loo Choo islands.</p>

<p>The Chinese are splendid workmen, providing you can
furnish them with a model or copy, for there is very little
genius, properly so-called, attached to John Chinaman.</p>

<p>Their imitative faculty and powers of memory are really
wonderful; as an instance of the former perhaps the
following may not be amiss:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the earlier days of the first occupation, the English
residents of Hong Kong were often placed in difficulties
about their clothing, Chinamen not having attained to
that perfection in the tailors' art which they now have
acquired. On one occasion an old coat was supplied
to a native tailor as a guide to the construction of a new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>one; it so happened the old garment had a carefully
mended rent in its sleeve&mdash;a circumstance the man
was prompt to notice&mdash;setting to at once, with infinite
pains, to make a tear of a similar size and shape in the new
coat, and to re-sew it with the exact number of stitches as
in the original."</p>

<p>The old stories we have heard at home about a Chinaman's
tail being designed that by it he may be hoisted to
heaven, and that if he lose it he may never hope to reach
that desirable altitude, have really no foundation in fact,
nor is it a fact, as sailors are apt to believe, that it is
nurtured for their special benefit as a convenient handle
for playing off practical jokes on the luckless possessors;
the truth being that the "queue," now so universally
prized amongst them, is a symbol of conquest forced upon
them by their hated Tartar-masters. Previous to the
seventeenth century the inhabitants of the middle kingdom
wore their hair much after the style of the people of
Corea, but after the Manchu conquest they were compelled
to adopt the present mode.</p>

<p>The city of Victoria is very prettily situated on the
slopes of an eminence which culminates in a peak at an
altitude of 1300 feet, and from which a most charming
and cheerful view of the sea on the one side, and the
harbour and the yellow sand-stone hills of China on the
other.</p>

<p>It is allowed to be the most cosmopolitan city in the
world. Representatives of races far in excess of the
Pentecostal catalogue, may be encountered in its streets
in any hour's walk; men of all shades of colour and of
every religious creed live here side by side in apparent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>perfect harmony. The Chinese who form the bulk of
the population live entirely apart from the "<i>Ung-moh</i>"
(red hair devils) as they flatteringly term us. English
manners and customs do not seem to have influenced the
native mind in the smallest degree, in spite of our charities
and schools&mdash;a fact we cannot wonder at, taking into
account our <i>diabolical</i> origin.</p>

<p>The town&mdash;by which I mean the European part of it&mdash;possesses
many public and private buildings of almost
palatial grandeur. Of these, Government house, the City
hall&mdash;including the museum and reading room, the
cathedral and college, the various banks, and the residences
of the great merchants may be cited as examples.
There is also a fine botanical garden, not nearly so large
as that at Singapore, but perhaps scarcely less beautiful,
and an extensive recreation and drill ground, where one
may see curious sights! pigtailed, loose-robed Chinamen
wielding the cricket-bat, and dealing the ball some creditable
raps too.</p>

<p>There is perhaps only one good street in the colony,
Victoria street or Queen's road; this traverses the city
from end to end, and constitutes the great business
thoroughfare of the place. After about an hour's walk
along it, for the first part under an arcade of trees, we
find ourselves in the filthy, unsavoury Chinese quarter,
as the nose is careful to remind you if there be any doubt
about it. They are certainly a very dirty race, these
Chinamen; the dirtiest on earth, I should be inclined to
say, considering their boasted civilization and vaunted
morals; and, though compelled by our sanitary laws to
live somewhat more cleanly than their enthralled brethren
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>on the continent, still they are dirty, and I'll hazard to
say a sight of the Chinese of this town would soon dispel
any illusions one might have nourished to the contrary.
A subsequent visit to the native city of Shanghai shewed
us to what disgusting depths humanity can descend in
this particular.</p>

<p>This enterprising people possess some very fine shops,
where you can purchase every known European commodity
at cheaper rates than of the European firms. Every
shop has a huge sign-board depending from the top of the
house to the bottom, whereon is recorded in vermillion
and gold characters, not so much the name as the virtues
of the man within, sometimes, too, his genealogical tree
is appended. Such expressions as "no cheating here"
or "I cannot deceive," are common, but, in nearly every
case, belie the character of the proprietor, who is a living
libel on the word honesty. Honesty! old Shylock even
would blush for them.</p>

<p>Here, where there is protection for life and property,
a shopkeeper surprises you at the rich and grand display
of his wares. In China proper, a dealer dare not show all
he is worth for fear of the mandarins, who, should one
chance to pass that way, would in all probability, cast his
covetous eyes on the poor man's property, and demand
whatever had taken his fancy. Nor may a poor man be in
possession of an article inconsistent with his position in
the social scale&mdash;he may not be the owner of a tiger's skin,
for instance, as none but mandarins and people of similar
position, are permitted such luxuries. This reminds one
of the time, not so very remote, when similar restrictions
were placed on dress in England.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>This system of mulcting is known all over China as
"<i>cum-shaw</i>," a system, too, which I would advise all sailors
to adopt in their dealings with the slippery race if they
would not be robbed. The vendor dare not say nay to a
mandarin; and, though it is a point of etiquette on the
part of the big man to offer payment, it is equally a point
of etiquette for the tradesman to refuse: a fact, it is said,
the mandarin always calculates on.</p>

<p>In addition to the orthodox shop, the streets are lined
with itinerants, orange stalls, betel-nut tables, heaps of
rags, and sundries, baskets of vegetables of very strange
appearance and strong penetrating odours, half-cooked
roots and leaves&mdash;for the people never eat a well-cooked
root or vegetable; it is from these principally that the
intolerable stench is proceeding.</p>

<p>What the Chinese eat is a mystery, and such queer
compounds enter into their <i>menu</i> that I would give everybody
who dines with a Chinaman this advice&mdash;don't
enquire too minutely into what is placed before you, or
you will eat nothing, and so offend your host; bolt it and
fancy it is something nice&mdash;and <i>fancy</i> goes for something
at times, I can assure you. That it requires a tremendous
effort on the part of the human stomach, the subjoined
"Bill of Fare" of a dinner given to Governor Hennessey
by one of the Chinese guilds will, perhaps, serve to shew:</p>

<p>Cats, too, are entertained as food, though I believe only
by the extremely poor, to whom nothing seems to come
amiss. One may frequently meet in the streets vendors
of poor puss, easily recognisable by their suggestive cry,
"mow (miow?) youk"&mdash;cat-meat!</p>

<p>One is struck with astonishment at the vast crowds
which always throng the streets, each unit of which seems
intent on some most important business, and looks as
though its accomplishment absorbed his whole being.
Perhaps it is only a few ounces of fish which he carries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>suspended from his ringer by a cord; but if it were the
emperor's diamonds he could not conduct himself with
more importance.</p>

<p>The ordinary means of conveyance in China is by the
sedan chair, a sort of box of cane-work supported on poles
for the convenience of the bearers, of whom there are
generally two, but frequently as many as six. The riding
is comfortable enough, and the springy motion imparted
by the rider's weight is one of the pleasantest sensations
I know of. Of course our tars, immediately they come
on shore and see something new, want to find out all
about it: hence sedan chairs are all the go, and a bad
time the poor coolies have of it, too; for "Jack" is all
motion, especially if he be in that semi-apathetic state
known as "east half south," as it not unfrequently happens
that he is. He compels his bearers to tax their
powers of endurance to the utmost, urging them by all the
endearing epithets in the nautical vocabulary to unheard-of
exertions, regardless of the luckless pedestrians in the
way.</p>

<p>Whilst we are on the return voyage through Queen's
road, I must just say a word or two about the people's
costume, which, as we observe, is nearly the same for both
sexes; for if there be any difference, it is but slight in
detail. Their dress is the most unbecoming and ungraceful
it is possible to conceive, and yet, we are bound to
admit, most refined. Had the women the redeeming
quality of beauty, or the charm of a pretty face, possibly
even this dress might appear to better advantage. A
coarse-looking black or blue blouse, of that material known
to us as "nankeen," a tiny apron confined to the waist by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>a slender scarlet cord&mdash;their only bit of bright color&mdash;short
wide trousers, almost as broad at the bottoms as
they are long, bare legs and feet&mdash;such is a vision of the
Chinese woman of the working classes. The dress of a
lady differs from this only in the nature of the material of
which the garments are made&mdash;in their case, silk as a rule&mdash;stockinged
feet, and silk shoes with thick while, though
extremely light, soles. Nations, like individuals, have
their fopperies; the celestials display this quality, particularly
in the coverings for the feet. The shoe, especially of
the females, is, beyond question, the most tasteful article in
their costume. It is, as I have said before, made of silk,
generally of a lavender, salmon, or rose color, embroidered
in beautiful and artistic patterns of leaves, flowers, and
insects. The soles are of the whitest doeskin; and so
particular are they that they shall retain their unsullied
appearance, that, like the cats, they seldom walk through
a wet or muddy street.</p>

<p>The system of binding the feet of the women is by no
means so universal as we have been led to believe, and
we must confess to having been deceived in this matter;
we all thought, probably, to have seen <i>all</i> the women with
that useful member reduced to the dimensions of a baby's
foot&mdash;instead of which, what do we really see? scarce one
deformed woman in all our walks. Yet this nation considers
this cramped, tortured lump (it has lost all semblance
to a foot) an index of beauty.</p>

<p>Their hair is by far their finest possession, which, with
their large almond-shaped eyes, is invariably of a black color.
I once saw a Chinaman with <i>red</i> hair, and you cannot
think how ludicrous his queue looked beside the sable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> tails of his brethren. The manner in which the women
dress their hair is most wonderful, and materially helps to
give them their uninviting appearance. They have a
fashion of sticking it out around the head in the shape of
a teapot, stiffened with grease and slips of bamboo. That
this style of head-dress enhances their ugliness very few
Europeans I think will deny; for some women whom we
have seen, with their hair combed neatly back over their
heads and coiled up in a trace behind, looked not altogether
uncomely.</p>

<p>The head is dressed but once in ten days; and as the
people sleep in their day clothes, the possibility is they
entertain about their persons a private menagerie of those
interesting creatures whose name looks so vulgar in print.
It is one of the commonest scenes in the streets to see a
Chinaman squat on the kerb-stone and turn up a fold or
two of his trousers to manipulate these little pests; and
even the high officials and well-to-do people look upon it
as no outrage to the proprieties, to be seen removing one
of "<i>China's millions</i>" from the garment of a friend or
guest.</p>

<p class="summary">PREPARATIONS FOR THE NORTH.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;AMOY.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;WUSUNG,
AND WHAT BEFELL US THERE.</p>

<p>Whatever pretensions to beauty our ship may
have possessed on leaving England&mdash;and that
she possessed some it is but fair to add&mdash;have
been greatly marred by the late voyage, and especially
by the washing down we encountered on the trip from
Manilla. The effect has been to reduce our once fairy
and glistening hull to a jaundiced mass of rust and stains.
Therefore are we to go into "weeds." Black certainly gives
an iron-clad a more man-of-war look, and a more war-like
effect, to say nothing of the superior ease with which it
can be kept clean.</p>

<p>January 22nd.&mdash;The Chinese new-year's day.&mdash;I should
consider even such a poor account of the Chinese as this
professes to be very incomplete, did it not contain something
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>as to the manner the people observe the festival of
the new year. And just a word before I start. It must
not be supposed that I gained the information, if it be
worthy to be classed as such, on a first visit to Hong
Kong. This part of my "journal," including the previous
chapter, has received the corrections and additions of
nearly four years' experience.</p>

<p>The Chinese new year&mdash;a movable feast&mdash;depending,
like all their chronological measurements, on the motions
of the moon, may occur as early as it does this
year, or it may fall as late as the middle of February.
It is to the celestials what Christmas day is to us,
and is observed by every true Chinaman most religiously:
not, be it understood, religiously in our and
the common acceptation of the term&mdash;for China has
no religion&mdash;it possesses a gigantic superstition; but
between a superstition and a religion, I need scarcely
add, a vast difference exists. To the practical mind of
John Chinaman, religious observances are made to subordinate
themselves to worldly interests.</p>

<p>During the time we have been on the station the
Shanghai district was once suffering from extreme drought.
The rain-god was appealed to&mdash;still no rain came. Well,
what was to be done? This. The god was admonished,
that if rain came not within a certain period something
terrible would happen to him. Still no rain. The
exasperated priests and people then took measures to
execute their threat. Putting a rope around the idol, the
people, with their united efforts, pulled him to the ground
to suffer further outrages at the hands of an ungrateful
mob. Thus much for their <i>religion</i>. But to continue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>The last month in the old year is spent in elaborate
preparation for the coming one. All arrears of business
are made up, all accounts closed and punctually discharged,
whilst everyone works his hardest to increase his
stock of money.</p>

<p>At midnight on the last of the old year a bell is heard
to toll, at which signal everybody rushes into the streets,
armed with squibs, crackers, Catherine wheels, and other
blatant pyrotechnical compositions; and as each tries to
outdo his neighbour in the din he creates, the noise
accompanying their discharge is the most satisfactory possible.
The temples and pagodas are brilliantly lighted
with colored lamps and colored candles, whilst similar
candles and "joss-sticks," and gold and silver paper,
illumine the interiors of their, at other times, grimy and
dingy abodes. When morning arrives, the streets present
a curious spectacle&mdash;everybody seems to be shaking hands
with <i>himself</i>. A Chinaman, on meeting and saluting a
friend, instead of seizing his hand, as we should, clasps
his own hands together, the right hand grasping the left,
which he sways up and down in front of his body.</p>

<p>Each person, too, is dressed in the newest and costliest
dress he can afford; and as there is but one universal
fashion of garment in China, everybody tries to surpass
everybody else in the richness of the material of which
his clothes are made. The children, in particular, come
out well, the girls especially, with highly-rouged and powdered
cheeks and necks, gaudily decorated "queue" (for
that appendix is not confined to the one sex), and silk
dresses of the most beautiful colors. The whole scene
has a very stage-like and brilliant effect.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>It is worthy of remark, as shewing another trait in this
truly remarkable race, that though they manufacture a very
fiery liquor (called "<i>samshaw</i>") from rice, yet you will
rarely see a drunken Chinaman in the streets. As far as I
can remember I have met with only one such, and he a
servant on board our ship, who had adopted a liking for
rum because, I suppose, it is the custom for a sailor to
drink what is issued to him.</p>

<p>The harbour, too, has its distinctive features on this gay
and festive occasion. Every junk is covered with great
pennons of silk in the most startling colors, whilst from
every available space small oblong pieces of paper, with
characters written on them, flutter to the breeze. These
are "<i>joss-papers</i>," and contain prayers for wealth, prosperity,
and (if they have not one already) an heir, "<i>joss</i>"
is the generic name they give to their idols, and the whole
ritual they call "<i>joss pidgin</i>." The priests they name
"<i>joss-men</i>," an appellation, too, they somewhat irreverently
bestow on our naval chaplains. One of the largest junks,
with a priest on board, and containing all the vessels and
objects pertaining to their ritual, makes the circuit of the
harbour&mdash;the priest meanwhile burning prayers and setting
off crackers for a blessing on the supply of fish for the
ensuing year.</p>

<p>January 29th.&mdash;This evening the officers gave their first
theatrical entertainment on board, the acting of some of
the characters being pronounced above the average; one
or two of the younger midshipmen, to whom the parts fell,
made very tempting and graceful ladies.</p>

<p>February 14th.&mdash;This day finds us at the back of the
island preparing for target practice. In one of the bays
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>here is an admirable natural target: a solitary rock rising
perpendicularly from the sea, with a mark painted on it,
is a most interesting thing to fire at, for you can observe
the effect of your shot. Behind this rock sloped a hill, on
which were seated, though unknown to us, two Chinamen;
the first half-a-dozen rounds were so true that the
unseen watchers had no suspicion they were in dangerous
quarters, or that it was possible that even the Duke's marksmen
were fallible; the seventh round disillusioned them,
for, from a slight fault in the elevation, the shot over-reached
the target and pitched so close to the Chinamen that
stones and rubbish came rattling down from everywhere
about their ears; fear lent them wings, and they scampered
off like the wind. They may be running now for aught I
know, as when we last saw them the horizon seemed to be
the goal they were aiming at.</p>

<p>March 10th.&mdash;We were to have put to sea to-day had
not a melancholy and fatal accident changed the whole
course of events. Richard Darcy, a young seaman, whilst
engaged on the crosstrees fell to the deck, striking the rail
on the topgallant forecastle in his fall. His body was
frightfully mangled and torn, his scull fractured, and all
his limbs broken. Mercifully he never regained consciousness.
Next day we buried him in the beautiful
cemetery of Happy Valley, than which there are few more
picturesque spots in China; 'twas surely a poetic fancy
which inspired the Chinese with the term "<i>happy</i>" when
naming this sylvian vale.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we slipped from the buoy and steamed
seaward for tactics, returning the following day to prepare
for going in dock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>March 26th.&mdash;The last day for our stay in Aberdeen.
A special steam launch had arrived from Hong Kong
during the forenoon with all the &eacute;lite of the city to see the
floating of our ship. However, they were doomed to
disappointment, for, on the tide reaching its highest, it
was found the ship refused to move, nor would she start,
though every effort was made to coax her. It was not
until the next tide, assisted by a strong breeze, that the
ship once more rested in deep water.</p>

<p>With characteristic expedition and commendable zeal,
our captain had the ship ready for sea, and awaiting orders
in the briefest possible time.</p>

<p>April 21st.&mdash;Early this morning that pleasant sound,
the cable rattling through the hawse, told us that we had
bid good-bye to Victoria, for a few months at least. A
rather stiff breeze was blowing at the time&mdash;a sufficient
hint that we might possibly meet with something rash
outside; nor was the hint to be disregarded, for, scarcely
had we cleared the mouth of the harbour, when, what
sailors call a "<i>sneezer</i>," accompanied by a green sea in all
our weather ports, met us as an introduction to our
northern cruise. So threatening was the look of the sky,
and remembering that in these seas old Boreas often
indulges his fancy in a gentle zephyr called a typhoon, it
was deemed expedient to seek shelter for the night.</p>

<p>On the third day out we reached Amoy, or rather the
outside anchorage of that harbour, to await daylight for
the passage up to the town.</p>

<p>So far as the little island settlement forming the foreign
concession can make it so, Amoy is a pretty enough place;
otherwise it is like all other Chinese towns, and wont
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>bear too close a scrutiny. It is built on an island of the
same name, and is walled in by several miles of embrasured
masonry; a fort or barracks on the beach, gay with
pennons, imparting a semi-military look to the place.
Flags seem to play a most important part in the usages
of war amongst this nation, for, in addition to the great
banners of the mandarins and their subordinates, every
soldier bears one in the muzzle of his rifle, or stuck in a
bamboo over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Resuming our course, after a stay of about forty-eight
hours, we next touched at the island of White Dogs, off
the port of Foo-Choo, the great naval dep&ocirc;t and arsenal
of China. The "Vigilant" had preceded us here to embark
the admiral for Foo-Choo, whilst we put to sea again.</p>

<p>April 30th.&mdash;At daylight we found ourselves amongst
an archipelago of picturesque and richly cultivated islands,
one mass of greenery from base to summit. The effect
produced by the different tints of the foliage was very
fine indeed. Beyond a doubt the Chinese exhibit great
skill and economy in the gardener's art.</p>

<p>This was the approach to Chusan, the largest island of
the group, at which we anchored at noon. The place fell
under a British attack in 1841, remaining in our possession
until the more convenient and more valuable island of
Hong Kong was ceded to us in exchange. Before us lies
a considerable town called Tinghae, where are buried
many of our poor fellow countrymen and their families
who fell victims to fever and the attacks of a cruel enemy
during the occupation. We found their graves in a very
neglected condition, many of the tombstones having been
appropriated by the inhabitants to prop up those architectural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>abominations which it would be a libel to term
houses. Admiral Coote subsequently sent the "Modeste"
down with orders to repair the burial ground; the
misappropriated stones were speedily restored to their
places by the blue-jackets, who dealt with the natives in a
very summary manner by wrecking their houses about
their ears.</p>

<p>It was not long before a sleek old Chinaman, rejoicing
in the imposing Chin-English name of "<i>Chin-Chang-Jim-Crow</i>,"
came on board and introduced himself as "me de
bumboat"; he further explained that it was so long since
a man-of-war had been in that neighbourhood, that
probably he would experience some difficulty in procuring
"<i>Chow</i>."</p>

<p>In the course of a day or so the admiral arrived from
Ningpo, which was the signal for our at once heaving up
anchor and continuing our voyage.</p>

<p>We are now in the estuary of one of the noblest rivers
of the world, and the largest in China. It is estimated
that this river, the Yang-tsze-Kiang, "Son of the Ocean,"
brings seaward, annually, as much solid matter as would
make an island as large as Ireland! The navigation of
its mouth is extremely dangerous, on account of the
constantly-shifting sandbanks and consequent alteration
of the channel. Fortunately, the European pilots are
very skilful in detecting these changes. It is usual for
large ships to drop anchor on this mud, locally termed
the "flats," until boarded by a pilot, who takes you either
to Wosung or Shanghai, according to your draught of
water.</p>

<p>Wosung scarcely merits the name of town; perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>with more accuracy it might be termed a village. It is
nevertheless, the head quarters of a large junk fleet, and
has one of the finest and strongest forts in China to
protect it from seaward. The place is interesting to us in
one sense, because in 1875 an English company obtained
permission to construct a line of rail from here to Shanghai.</p>

<p>China, with its four thousand years of existence, looked
on this innovation with a jealous eye, and would have
pitched the whole concern into the river, had she dared;
unfortunately the line was carried near a burying ground,
and thus a ready excuse for stopping the work presented
itself. It was alleged that the noise would disturb the
spirits of the dead, of whom the Chinese are in ghostly
fear. An almost similar difficulty was met when the
arsenal was built at Foo-Choo, and a magnificent temple
was actually erected in that city for the accommodation
of the refugee spirits.</p>

<p>To bring matters to a climax a man was run over by
one of the trucks and killed. The mandarins could no
longer hold out against the popular voice, and the whole
plant was bought up by the Government for twice the sum
the projectors had spent about it.</p>

<p>This is the brief history of the first and, up to now, the
only attempt to introduce railways into China; but the
late Kuldja difficulty, and the ease with which the Russians
had brought an army to their Siberian frontier, have
caused the Chinese to open their eyes to the advantage of
railways for strategic, if for no other purpose, and I believe
a line is already in contemplation between Tien-tsin and
the capital.</p>

<p>Owing to a blunder on the part of the pilot, so some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>said, and some others, in consequence of someone else's
blunder, our anchor was dropped too near a mud bank,
with the result that when the ship swung to a firm knot
current, up she went high and dry. Means were at once
taken to get her off, but by the time all the necessary
arrangements were completed&mdash;and there was no time
lost either&mdash;the tide had ebbed considerably.</p>

<p>In the middle watch of this, the "Iron Duke's" first night
on the Chinese territory, the steel hawser was brought to
the capstan, but a piece of yarn would have been equally
efficacious; for, under the immense strain, it snapped like
a bow string, and, as there was now nothing to keep the
stern in check, away she went broadside on to the
difficulty.</p>

<p>Meantime a telegram had been wired to the admiral at
Shanghai, and next day all the available help at that port
came down the river to our assistance; besides the
"Vigilant," "Eyera," "Midge," and "Growler," there
were two American war vessels, the "Monocasy" and
"Palos," also a Chinese paddle steamer.</p>

<p>On the third night a combined attempt was made to
either haul us off or to pull us to pieces. With all their
tugging they effected neither the one nor the other, and,
had not nature "lent us a fin"&mdash;in the shape of a breeze
of wind&mdash;we might have been lying there to this day; a
few pulls on our hawsers and we had the satisfaction of
feeling that the dear old craft was once more on her
proper element. The commander of one of the American
ships afterwards commenting on the difficulty experienced
in removing us, hailed our captain with "Guess, Cap'n,
that piece of machinery of yours is lumpy!" "Rather,
Jonothan, I calculate."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>Had we not floated to-day the alternative was rather
consoling; nothing less than the removal of all our heavy
guns and spars.</p>

<p>Before our departure Shanghai was all astir at the visit
of General Grant of the United States. Ostensibly, the
general is travelling <i>incog.</i>, but really as the representative
of the United States, for he flies the "stars and stripes"
at the main, and gets a salute of twenty-one guns wherever
he goes. For some reason or other we did not salute as
he passed up the river.</p>

<p>May 22nd saw us clearing out of the dangerous precincts
of the Shanghai river and shaping our course across the
turbid waters of the Yellow Sea for pastures new&mdash;that is
to say&mdash;for Japan. Under double-reefed canvas and a
nine knot breeze we sighted land in the vicinity of
Nagasaki on the 25th, and by evening our anchor "kissed
the mud" in as lovely a spot as ever mortal set eyes on.
But I will reserve my eulogies for another chapter.</p>

RUN THROUGH THE TOWN.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;VISIT TO A SINTOR TEMPLE.</p>


<p>I know not if the author of the above lines had
ever been to Japan. I should think it very unlikely;
and possibly the poet is but describing the scenery of
his Cumberland home. In no disparagement of the
beauteous country of the lake and mountain, yet we must
confess that nothing there can compare with Japan's
natural magnificence.</p>

<p>All who have ever written of Japan, or who have ever
visited its shores, are unanimous in the praise they bestow
on its charms of landscape. Even rollicking and light-hearted
tars, who, as a rule, are not very sensible to the
beauties of nature, are bound to use "unqualified expressions
of delight," when that "bright banner" lies unfurled
under their gaze. And of all this beauteous land no part
of it is more beautiful than the bay of Ommura, in the
month of May.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>Coming towards Nagasaki, from the westward, is like
sailing on to a line of high, rigid, impenetrable rocks, for,
apparently, we are heading blindly on to land which discloses
not the slightest indication of an opening; but,
relying on the accuracy of our charts, and the skill of our
officers, we assume we are on the right course. By-and-bye
the land, as if by some magic power, seems to rend
asunder, and we find ourselves in a narrow channel, with
well-wooded eminences on either hand, clothed with
handsome fir trees. Right in front of us, and hiding the
view of the town, is a small cone-shaped island of great
beauty. English is a weak language in which to express
clearly its surpassing loveliness. This is Takabuko, or
more familiarly, Papenberg, a spot with a sad and bloody
history, for it was here that the remnant of the persecuted
Christians, who escaped the general massacre in
1838,&mdash;when 30,000 perished&mdash;made a last ineffectual
stand for their lives and faith. But to no purpose, for
pressed to extremities by the swords of their relentless
persecutors, they threw themselves over the heights, and
perished in the sea.</p>

<p>The people are not altogether to blame for this barbarous
and cruel persecution. Had the Jesuits been satisfied
with their spiritual conquests, and not sought to subvert
the government of the country, all might have gone well,
and Japan, ere now, been a Christian country. But no;
true to themselves and to their Order, they came not to
bring peace, but literally a sword, and the innocent were
made to suffer for the ambitions of a few designing priests.</p>

<p>The island passed, what a view presents itself! The
long perspective of the bay, the densely wooded hills and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>lower slopes teeming with agricultural produce, rich
corn-fields, ripe for the sickle; picturesque dwellings, hid
in shadowy foliage, and flowers and fruit trees, to which
the purity and rarity of the atmosphere lend a brilliancy
of colouring and distinctness of outline, impossible to
describe; the clear blue water, with here and there a
quaint and curious-looking junk, resting on its glassy and
reflecting surface; the town, sweeping around the shores
of the bay; and, afar, the majesty of hill and vale; such,
dear reader, is a weak and very imperfect word picture of
the charming bay of Omura.</p>

<p>Recent events in Japan have taken such a remarkable
turn, that history, neither ancient nor modern, presents
no parallel with it. That we may have a more adequate
conception of the Japan of to-day, it is absolutely necessary
that we make some acquaintance with the Japan of
the past.</p>

<p>Of the origin of the people we can gleam very little,
except from the questionable source of tradition. Several
theories are advanced to account for their existence here.
One authority discovers in them the long-lost "lost
tribes of Israel;" according to another, they are a branch
of the great American-Indian family; both of which
statements we had better accept with caution. Their
own theory&mdash;or rather that of the aborigines, the A&iuml;nos of
Yeso,&mdash;a race whom the indefatigable Miss Bird has
recently brought prominently before the world&mdash;states
that the goddess of the celestial universe, a woman of
incomparable beauty and great accomplishments, came
eastward to seek out the most beautiful spot for a terrestrial
residence, and at length chose Japan, where she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>spent her time in cultivating the silkworm, and in the
Diana-like pursuits of the chase; until one day, as she
stood beside a beautiful stream, admiring her fair form in
its reflecting surface, she was startled by the sudden
appearance of a large dog. Tremblingly she hid herself,
but the dog sought her out, and, to her surprise, entered
into conversation with her, and finally into a more
intimate alliance. From the union of these two opposite
natures&mdash;according to this account&mdash;the A&iuml;nos are
descended.</p>

<p>One other tradition I will mention&mdash;the Chinese&mdash;which
perhaps has something of the truth in it. According
to it, a certain emperor of China, ruminating on the
brevity of human life, and of his own in particular,
thought it possible to find a means whereby his pleasant
existence might be indefinitely prolonged. To this end
he summoned all the physicians in his kingdom, and
ordered them, on pain of forfeiting their heads, to discover
this remedy. After much deliberation, one at last
hit upon a plan which, if successful, would be the means
of saving, at least, his own head. He informed the
emperor that in a land to the eastward, across the Yellow
Sea, was the panacea he sought; but that, in order to
obtain it, it was necessary to fit out a ship, with a certain
number of young virgins, and an equal number of young
men of pure lives, as a propitiatory offering to the stern
guardian of the "elixir of life." The ship sailed, freighted
as desired, and after a few days reached the western
shores of Japan, from whence, you will readily imagine,
the wily sage never returned. These young men and
maidens became the ancestors of the Japanese race.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Their form of government was despotic in its character,
and feudal in its system. The country was governed by
a powerful ruler with the title of mikado&mdash;"son of the
sun"&mdash;who was supported in his despotism by tributary
princes, or daimios. Of them the mikado demanded
military service in time of war, and also compelled them
to reside a part of each year in his capital, where quarters
were provided for them and their numerous retainers in
the neighbourhood of the palace. The visitor may still
see whole streets in Tokio without a single inhabitant,
the former residences of the daimios' followers, and the
aspect is dreary in the extreme.</p>

<p>In addition to his temporal functions, the mikado has
always been the great high priest of the Sintor faith.
On the breaking out of a war with China, it was found
that his attendance with the army would deprive the
religion of its spiritual head, and so indispensable was his
presence in the great temple, that such a deprivation
would be little short of a calamity. In this dilemma, he
called to his aid the general of his forces, an able
warrior and a shrewd designing man, conferred on him the
hereditary title of shio-goon, or tycoon, and despatched
him at the head of the army to carry fire and sword into
the coasts of China. This prince's name was Tycosama,
a name great in Japan's history, and destined to become
terrible to the Christians. As generally happens, when a
clever soldier with a devoted army at his back is placed
in such a position, he finds it but a step to supreme
dominion, the army being a pretty conclusive argument in
his favor. His first act was the removal of the mikado
to the holy city, Kioto, where henceforth he was kept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>secluded, and hemmed in by so much mystery, that the
people began to look upon their ancient ruler as little less
than a god.</p>

<p>It will be readily imagined that the tycoons, by their
arrogant assumption to the imperial dignity, made for
themselves many enemies amongst the powerful daimios.
The disaffected united to form a party of reaction which,
in the end, overthrew the tycoon, restored the mikado
to his ancient splendour, and gave Japan to the world.
In 1853, an American squadron, under Commodore
Perry, came to Yokohama, and demanded a trade
treaty with the United States. After much circumlocution
he obtained one, thus pioneering a way for the
Europeans. England demanded one the following year,
and got it; then followed the other maritime nations of
Europe, but these treaties proved to be of as little value
as the paper on which they were drawn up.</p>

<p>The adherents of the tycoon displayed a bitter
animosity against the foreigner, and especially a most
powerful daimio, the prince of Satsuma, who nourished a
detestable hatred to Europeans. Through the machinations
of this party, murders of foreigners, resident in
Yokohama, were of almost daily occurrence, till at last
the British consul fell a victim to their hatred. This
brought matters to a head. In 1863, England declared
war against Japan; blockaded the Inland Seas with a
combined squadron of English, French, Dutch, and
American ships, acting under the orders of Admiral
Keuper, stormed and captured Simonoseki, and burnt
Kagosima, the capital of the prince of Satsuma. Having
brought the Japanese to their senses, we demanded of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>them a war indemnity, half of which was to be paid by
Satsuma.</p>

<p>Five years passed. The mikado meanwhile had placed
himself at the head of the reactionary party, pensioned
the tycoon, and made rapid advancement in European
manners and customs. In 1868, Satsuma and his party
broke out into open rebellion against the mikado. But
the prince's levies were no match for the imperial troops,
armed with the snider, and the result was the rebellion,
after some sanguinary battles, was put down, the estates
of the rebels confiscated, and the chief actors in the
drama banished to distant parts of the empire.</p>

<p>There, dear reader, I am as glad as you that I have
finished spinning that yarn. Now for the legitimate
narrative.</p>

<p>Nagasaki, or more correctly Nangasaki, is a town of
considerable magnitude, skirting the shores of the bay,
and built in the form of an amphitheatre. On the
terraces above the town, several large temples with graceful,
fluted, tent-like roofs, embowered in sombre and
tranquil pine groves, shew out distinctly against the dark
background, whilst the thousands of little granite monumental
columns of the burying grounds, stud the hills on
every side, giving to Nagasaki almost a distinct feature.</p>

<p>Immediately ahead of the anchorage is the small island
of Desima, the most interesting portion of the city to
Europeans. Previous to 1859 it was the only part of
Japan open to foreigners, and even then only to the
Dutch, who, for upwards of 200 years, had never been
allowed to set foot outside the limits of the island,&mdash;a
space 600 feet long by 150 feet broad&mdash;separated from
the main land by the narrowest of canals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>Japanese towns are laid out in regular streets, much
after the fashion obtaining in Europe. The system of
drainage is abominable, though personally, the people are
the cleanest on earth, if constant bathing is to be taken as
an index to cleanliness. The streets have no footpaths,
and access to the houses is obtained by three or four
loose planks stretching across the open festering gutters.
As a natural result, small pox and cholera commit yearly
ravages amongst the populace. Another great evil against
good sanitation, exists in the shallowness of their graves.
The Japanese have also a penchant for unripe fruits.</p>

<p>A native house is a perfect model of neatness and simplicity.
A simple framework, of a rich dark coloured
wood, is thrown up, and roofed over with rice straw.
There is but one story, the requisite number of apartments
being made by means of sliding wooden frames,
covered with snow-white rice paper. The floor is raised
off the ground about eighteen inches, and is covered with
beautiful and delicately wrought straw mattresses, on
which the inmates sit, recline, take their meals, and sleep
at night. These habitations possess nothing in the shape
of furniture; no fireplace even, because the Japanese&mdash;like Chinese&mdash;never
use fire to warm themselves, the
requisite degree of warmth being obtained by the addition
of more and heavier garments. These abodes present a
marked contrast to the Chinese dwellings, which, as we
saw, were foul and grimy, whilst here all is cheerful and
airy.</p>

<p>No house is complete without its tiny garden of dwarf
trees, its model lakes, in which that curiosity of fish-culture,
the many tailed gold and silver fish, are to be seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>disporting themselves; its rockeries spanned by bridges;
its boats and junks floating about on the surface of the
lakes, in fact a Japanese landscape in miniature.</p>

<p>It seems the privilege of a people, who live in a land
where nature surrounds them with bright and beautiful
forms, to, in some manner, reflect these beauties in their
lives. This people possess these qualities in an eminent
degree, for a happier, healthier, more cheerful race, one
will rarely see. Their children&mdash;ridiculously like their
seniors from wearing the same style of garment&mdash;are the
roundest, rosiest, chubbiest little pieces of humanity ever
born. Everybody has a fresh, wholesome look, due to
repeated ablutions. The bath amongst the Japanese, as
amongst the ancient Romans, is a public institution; in
fact, we think too public, for both sexes mix promiscuously
together in the same bath, almost in the full light of
day; whilst hired wipers go about their business in a
most matter-of-fact manner. This is a feature of the
people we cannot understand, but they themselves consider
it no impropriety. A writer on Japan, speaking of
this says:&mdash;"We cannot, with justice, tax with immodesty
the individual who, in his own country, wounds none of
the social proprieties in the midst of which he has been
brought up." These bath-houses are perfectly open to the
public gaze, no one evincing the slightest curiosity to
look within, except, perhaps, the diffident sailor. It is
very evident that Mrs. Grundy has not yet put in her censorious
appearance in Japan, nor have our western
conventionalities set their seal on what, after all, is but a
single act of personal cleanliness. "<i>Honi soit qui mal y
pense.</i>"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> Their mode of dress is an embodiment of simplicity
and elegance. Both sexes wear a sort of loose dressing
gown, sometimes of silk&mdash;mostly so in the case of the fair
sex&mdash;crossed over the front of their bodies, allowing the
knee perfect liberty to protrude itself, if it is so minded,
and confined to the waist by a band. But it is more
particularly of the dress of the ladies I wish to speak.
The band circling the waist, and known as the "<i>obe</i>," is
very broad, and composed of magnificent folds of rich
silk, and tied up in a large quaint bow behind. A Japanese
lady lavishes all her taste on the selection of the
material and in the choice of colour, of which these bands
are composed, and which are to them what jewellery is to
the more refined Europeans. No ornament of the precious
metal is ever seen about their persons. Their taste
in the matter of hues is faultless; no people, I will
venture to say, have such a perception of the harmonies
of colour. Their tints are of the most delicate and
charming shades the artist's fancy or the dyer's art can
furnish, and often wrought in rich and elegant patterns.
They are passionately fond of flowers, the dark and
abundant tresses of their hair being always decorated
with them, either real or artificial. Their only other
adornments are a tortoise-shell comb of delicate workmanship,
and a long steel pin with a ball of red coral in
the end, passing through their rich raven hair. They use
powder about their necks and shoulders pretty freely, and
sometimes colour the under lip a deep carmine, or even
gold, a process which does not add to their personal
attractions. They wear no linen; a very thin chemise of
silk crepe, in addition to the loose outer garment, is all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>their covering. But it must be remembered that the great
aim of this people seems to be simplicity, therefore we
wont too minutely scrutinize their deficiencies of costume;
there is much to be said in its favour, it is neither immodest
nor suggestive. The feet are clothed in a short
sock, with a division at the great toe for the passage of the
sandal strap. These sandals or clogs are the most
ungainly articles in their wardrobe. A simple lump of
wood, the length and breadth of the foot, about two or
three inches in altitude, and lacquered at the sides, is
their substitute for our boot. Their walk is a shuffling
gait, the knee bent and always in advance of the body.</p>

<p>The married women have a curious custom&mdash;now fast
dying out&mdash;of blacking their teeth and plucking out their
eye-brows to prevent, as their husbands say, other men
casting "sheep's eyes" at them.</p>

<p>The males of the coolie class are very scantily clad, for
all that they wear is the narrowest possible fold of linen
around the loins; but, as if to compensate for this scarcity
of rigging, they are frequently most elaborately tattooed
from head to foot.</p>

<p>A Japanese husband does not make a slave of his wife,
as is too often the case amongst orientals; she is allowed
perfect liberty of action, and to indulge her fancy in innocent
pleasures to an unlimited extent. Her lord is not
ashamed to be seen walking beside her, nor does he think
it too much beneath him to fondle and carry the baby in
public. They are excessively fond of their children; the
hundreds of toy shops and confection stalls about the
streets bearing testimony to this.</p>

<p>The old custom of dressing the hair, which some of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>the men still affect, is rather peculiar. A broad gutter
is shaved from the crown of the head forward, whilst the
remaining hair, which is permitted to grow long, is
gathered and combed upwards, where the ends are tied,
marled down, and served over (as we should say in nautical
phraseology) and brought forward over the shaven
gangway.</p>

<p>One other custom I must mention, the strangest one of
all: they have a legalized form of that vice which, in
other countries, by tacit consent, is banned, but which
even the most refined people must tolerate. But what
makes it more strange still is, that no inconsiderable portion
of the public revenue is derived from this source.
The government sets aside a certain quarter in every city
and town for its accommodation, gives it a distinct and
characteristic name, and appoints officers over it for the
collection of the revenues. I thought it not a little
significant on landing for the first time in Japan to find
myself and "rick-sha" wheeled, by the accommodating
coolie, right into the heart of this quarter. The advances
of the fair sex are likely to prove embarrassing to the
stranger, for, before they are married, they are at liberty to
do as they please, and do not, by such acts, lose caste or
forfeit the respect of their friends and neighbours.</p>

<p>Here, as in the Indian Seas, our <i>laundresses</i> are men, the
cleanest and quickest washers we have encountered in the
voyage. As an instance of their despatch, they will take
your bedding ashore in the morning, and by tea-time you
will receive it ready for turning in, the blanket washed
and dried, the hair teazed and made so soft that you
would scarcely fancy it was the same old "doss" again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> Though the women do not wash our clothes, they do
what is far harder work, <i>i.e.</i> coal our ship. We were surprised,
beyond measure, to see women toiling away at this
dirty, laborious calling. And the Japanese women are
such little creatures, too! There was, however, one
exception, a woman of herculean strength and limb, looking
like a giantess amongst her puny sisters, and fully
conscious of her superior muscular power. This lady,
stripped to the waist as she was, would, I am sure, intimidate
the boldest mariner from a too close acquaintance
with her embrace. They belong to the coolie class, a
distinct caste in Japan, wear a distinguishing badge on
their clothing, form a community amongst themselves,
and rarely marry out of their own calling.</p>

<p>At noon these grimy Hebes, Hercules as well, all
tripped on board to dine, the upper battery offering them
all the accommodation they required; each carried with
her a little lacquered box, with three sliding drawers, in
which was neatly and cleanly stowed her dinner&mdash;rice, fish,
and vegetables; taking out all the drawers, and laying
them on her lap, with a pair of chop-sticks, she soon
demolished her frugal meal. After a whiff or two at a
pipe, whose bowl just contained enough tobacco for two
draws, she was ready to resume her work.</p>

<p>The European concession occupies the most picturesque
position in Nagasaki, from which city it is separated by a
creek, well known to our blue-jackets, spanned by two or
three bridges. On either side of this strip of water a
perfect cosmopolitan colony of beer-house keepers have
assembled, with the sole intention of "bleeding" the
sailor, and upon whose well-known devotion, to the shrine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>of Bass and Allsop, they manage to amass considerable
fortunes.</p>

<p>Before leaving Nagasaki I would ask you to accompany
me to one of the temples, that known as the Temple of
the Horse, being, perhaps, the best. It is rather a long
distance by foot, but Englishmen, at least according to
Japanese ideas, have too much money to walk when they
can ride, so to keep up the national conceit, but more for
our own convenience, we jump into an elegant little carriage,
or "<i>jin-riki-sha</i>," literally "<i>man-power-carriage</i>,"
but in sailor phrase "johnny-ring-shaw," or short "ring
shaw." Away we go, a dozen or more in a line, over the
creek bridge, past Desima, which we leave on our left
hand, and soon we are in the heart of the native city, and
traversing what is popularly known as "curio" street. At
this point we request our human horses to trot, instead of
going at the mad speed usual to them, in order that we
make notes of Japanese life by the way. We pass many
shops devoted to the sale of lacquer ware, for which the
Japanese are so justly famed, catch glimpses of unequalled
egg shell, and Satsuma china, made of a clay, formed only
in this neighbourhood, and which, thanks to the European
mania for collecting, fetch the most fancy prices; get a
view of silk shops, full of rich stuffs and embroideries.
Here an artist tinting a fan or a silk lantern; there a
woman weaving cloth for the use of her household and
everywhere people plying their various callings on the
elevated floors of their houses. I should say needle
making amongst these people is a rather laborious undertaking,
and one which requires more than an ordinary
amount of patience. The wire has first to be cut the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>desired length, then filed to a point at one end and the
other flattened ready for the eye to be drilled, and finally
the whole has to be filed up and smoothed off, and all by
one man. The Japanese are but indifferent sewers, all
their seams exhibiting numerous "holidays." Pretty
children, with their hair clipped around their heads like a
priest's tonsure, sport around us, but are not intrusive.
Each child has a little pouch attached to his girdle, which,
we are informed, contains the address of the child's
parents, and also an invocation to the little one's protecting
god, in case of his straying from home. We meet
with cheerful looks and pleasant greetings everywhere.
The gentle and musical "<i>o-hi-o</i>," "<i>good day</i>," with its
softly accented second syllable, and as we pass the earnest
"<i>sayonara</i>," the "<i>au revoir</i>" of the French, tell us very
plainly we are no unwelcome visitors, whilst their bows
are the most graceful, because natural, and therefore
unaffected, actions it is possible to conceive.</p>

<p>We notice, too, that numbers of the males are in full
European costume, which generally hangs about them in a
most awkward manner, reminding one of a broom-handle
dressed in a frock coat. Others, again, don't discard the
national dress altogether, but compromise matters by
putting on, in addition their long gown, a European hat
and shoes, which, if anything, looks worse still. The
ladies have not yet adopted the European style which,
perhaps, they have sense enough to see, is far more complex
and inconvenient than their own. Of this much I
am certain that no mysterious production of Worth would
be more becoming, or suit them better than their own
graceful, national dress.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>At our imperative "<i>chop</i>, <i>chop</i>," jack's sole stock-in-trade
of that intellectual puzzle, the Chinese language, and
which he finds equally serviceable this side the water, our
Jehus start off like an arrow shot from a bow. What
endurance these men possess, and what limbs!</p>

<p>After a pleasant half-an-hour's ride, a sudden jolt
indicates we are at our destination.</p>

<p>We alight at the base of a flight of broad stone stairs
leading to the temple, and which we can just discern at
a considerable altitude above us, peeping out of the dark
shadow of a grove of firs. Arches of a curious and
simple design, under which it is necessary to pass, are the
distinguishing features of a kami or sintoo temple, and
perhaps of Japan itself, as the pyramids are characteristic
of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Two uprights of bronze, stone, or wood, inclined to
each other at the summits, and held in position by a
transverse beam piercing the pillars at about three feet
from their tops. Over this again is another beam with
horn-like curves at the ends, and turned upward, and
simply laid on the tops of the shafts. The approaches to
some of these temples are spanned by hundreds of such
structures, which, when made of wood and lacquered
bright vermillion, look altogether curious.</p>

<p>On the topmost stair, as if guarding the main entrance
to the sanctuary, are two seated idols of the "god of war,"
in complete armour, each with bow in hand and a quiver
full of arrows over his shoulder, and protected by a cage
work of wire. What certainly gives us matter for speculation,
and causes us no little surprise, is to see the golden
scales of their splendid armour, and even their ruddy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>lacquered faces, bespattered with pellets of chewed paper
after the manner familiar to us as school boys; when not
satisfied with the correctness of the geographers, we used
to chew blotting paper to fling in recent discoveries on the
wall maps. Do these people desecrate their idols thus?
There is no desecration here. These little lumps of pulp are
simply <i>prayers</i>, pieces of paper on which the priests have
traced some mystic characters for the use of the devout,
and which, because of their inability to reach the idol to
paste the strips on, they shoot through the wire in this
manner.</p>

<p>We now pass under the last arch, with its monstrous
swinging paper lantern, into the courtyard of the temple.
The first object which claims our attention is a bronze
horse, from which the temple takes its name. The work
of art&mdash;for so it is reckoned&mdash;would be more like a horse,
if its tail were less suggestive of a pump handle. Near
is a bronze trough filled with holy water, to be applied
internally; and around three sides of the square numerous
empty houses, which, on high days and holidays,
are used as shops for the sale of sacred and fancy articles.
Up a few more steps and suddenly we are on the polished
floor of the temple, and standing amidst a throng of
kneeling worshippers, with heads bowed and hands
pressed together in prayer.</p>

<p>Their mode of procedure at these shrines seems something
after the following: the worshipper first seizes a
straw rope depending from the edge of the roof of the
temple, to which is attached a bell, of that shape worn by
ferrets at home, only of course on a much more gigantic
scale; this is to apprise the slumbering god of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>applicant's presence. He then commences his petition
or confession; places an offering of money in a large
trough-like receptacle for the purpose; takes a drink at
the holy water font, and departs to his home chatting
gaily to his neighbours as he descends the steps. The
whole business occupies about five minutes.</p>

<p>Sintoo temples have but little interior or body. All the
worshipping is done outside on the beautifully kept
polished floor. A notice in English reminds us vandals
that we must remove our shoes if we would tread this
sacred spot.</p>

<p>Within, is simplicity itself; a mirror and a crystal ball is
all one sees; the former typical of the ease with which the
Almighty can read our hearts; the second an emblem of
purity. They worship the Supreme Being under the
threefold title, which, strangely enough, we find in the
Book of Daniel, by which we may infer they have no
inadequate conception of the true God.</p>

<p>We leave the temple court by a different outlet to that
by which we entered, and come out on a charmingly laid
out garden and fish ponds, where are seats and tea houses
for the accommodation of visitors. Each tea house has
its bevy of dark-eyed houris, who use every wile and
charm known to the sex, to induce you to patronise their
several houses. To do the proper thing, and perhaps
influenced by the bright eyes raised so beseechingly to
ours, we adjourn to one of these restaurants. Removing
our shoes&mdash;a proceeding you are bound to comply with
before entering a Japanese house&mdash;we seat ourselves
cross-legged, tailor fashion, on the straw mattresses I have
previously mentioned, whilst an attendant damsel, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>deft fingers, makes the tea in a little terra-cotta teapot,
the contents of which she poured into a number of doll's
cups, without handles, on a lacquered tray. Other girls
handed us each a cup, in which was a liquid not unlike
saffron water in colour and in taste.</p>

<p>They use neither milk nor sugar, and the cups are so
provokingly small, that it is only by keeping our attendant
syrens under the most active employment, that we are at
last able to say we have tasted it. With our tea we get
some excellent sponge cake called "<i>casutira</i>," a corruption
of the Spanish word "castile," said to be, until very
recently, the only word of European etymology in the
language. The Jesuits first introduced the cake from
Spain, and taught the people how to make it. Whatever
its origin, it is very good. You get chop-sticks handed
you too, which, after a few ineffectual and laughable
attempts to manipulate in the approved fashion, you
throw on one side. After the decks are cleared the
young ladies bring out their <i>sam-sins</i>, and whilst we
smoke Japanese pipes, they delight our ears with an
overture, which we pronounce excruciating in English,
though with our eyes we say "divine as Patti."</p>

<p>But we must not tarry longer here for the setting sun
warns us it is time to get on board.</p>

<p>Our patient "steeds" are at the foot of the stairs, each
ready to claim his rider. These fellows will stick to you
like a leech; follow you about for hours, never intruding
their presence on you, and yet seem to anticipate all your
movements and wants.</p>

VISIT TO TOKIO.</p>


<p>The arrival of the "Vigilant" from Shanghai, with
the admiral on board, brought our stay at charming
Nagasaki to a close. During the absence of our
band with the "Vigilant," one of its members, Henry
Harper, a feeble old man, and far advanced in consumption,
died at Shanghai.</p>

<p>June 11th.&mdash;Left Nagasaki <i>en route</i> for the eastward,
<i>via</i> the Inland Seas. Our way to Simoneski lay through
numerous islands of so beautiful an appearance that a
writer has compared them to some of the fairest spots in
Devon. But this, though it says much, is but a poor
tribute to such enchanting loveliness.</p>

<p>At daylight the following morning we made the narrow
channel at Simoneski, the western entrance to the seas;
and as there is always a strong rush of water through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>passage towards the ocean, we had to steam hard against
a considerable current. The town, of which I spoke in
my last chapter, has a very straggling and neat cleanly
appearance. There are no forts or other defences to indicate
that not so long ago this town offered defiance and a
short resistance to a European squadron.</p>

<p>The Inland Sea has four chief divisions, which now
commences to open out before us, and is reckoned to
possess some of the finest scenery in the world. I had
often wished to see it for myself; but I must confess I
was unprepared, even with an imagination not liable to
surprise, at a picture of nature's own producing, for such
beauty and grandeur. For hundreds of miles, day after
day, we were borne past a moving diorama of scenery
unrivalled by anything here below. On a smooth blue
sea, and under a cloudless sky, onward we sped, passing,
one after another, the most delightful islets the eye ever
dwelt on, each appearing to us a perfect paradise in
itself. Further on, indicated by a mere purple haze,
appeared others, and yet others, in almost endless perspective.
I should say the islands in this sea may be
numbered by thousands.</p>

<p>Not many years since, strangers were debarred from
using this passage. I fancy I can imagine the impressions
the first Europeans must have had of this fairy land, of
such a climate, such a soil, and such delightful glades and
woodlands!</p>

<p>On each of the larger islands we noticed snug temples,
like miniature Swiss chalets, embowered in woods&mdash;their
peculiar architecture standing out in relief from a tangled
mass of vegetation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>The channels where there are so many islands as here
are necessarily intricate and dangerous; and as it would
be to court danger to continue our course after sundown,
there are several well-marked anchorages where it is customary
to bring up at night. The first of these was a
sheltered bay with twin villages at its head, which I fancifully
designated Kingsand and Cawsand&mdash;the promontory
forming one arm of the bay, looking not unlike Penlee
point&mdash;greatly adding to the conceit.</p>

<p>June 14th.&mdash;At noon we reached Kob&eacute;, or Hiogo, and
let go our anchor far out in what appears to be an open
roadstead. This town is one of the most recent of the
treaty ports&mdash;in fact it and Osaca opposite, are the last
thrown open to trade; hence we shall probably find Kob&eacute;
more <i>native</i> and less Europeanized than are the other
towns we shall visit.</p>

<p>The native town is very extensive, reaching far back to
the basis of the hills, and well away to the left of the
anchorage. To the right a stretch of low-lying land, with
its tiny fields of ripe grain, looks very fine. This track
leads to the water-falls&mdash;a prettier place for a pic-nic and
one more accommodating one can scarcely find. Between
this plain and the old town of Hiogo the Europeans have
raised their pretty picturesque dwellings. The streets
here are very regular and well kept, the trees planted
along the sides giving the place quite a French appearance.</p>

<p>There is at least one I was about to say magnificent
street in the town, with an extent of over two miles,
along and in which all the bustle and business are conducted.
Notwithstanding its recent opening, public-houses,
with their alluring signs, have sprung up with mushroom-like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>rapidity. One in particular I will just mention, not
that you are ever likely to forget "Good old Joe," but
simply that you may smile, when reading this over, at the
willingness with which you were led as lambs to the
slaughter. I trust you escaped without the mark of the
butcher's knife.</p>

<p>After traversing about half the length of the street I
mentioned before, the traveller finds himself abreast of
the Nanko temple, a large and imposing structure having
a wide and noble-looking entrance from the street, and
just now presenting a very festive and animated appearance.
On either side the really grand avenue to the
temple a veritable fair is being held, and such a spectacle
was as welcome as it was unlooked for. The amusements
were so like those provided at similar gatherings at home
that the wonder is, that peoples separated by half a world
of varied civilization can possess the details of such festivities
in common. Confection stalls, wild beast shows,
shooting galleries, archery grounds, theatres, music halls,
even a Japanese edition of the thimble-and-pea business
was not wanting. In one of the theatres we visited, the
acting, although considered good from a Japanese point
of view, possessed too many muscular contortions, too
much contraction and expansion of the facial organs, to
please an English audience. Men do all the acting,
women never appear on the Japanese stage.</p>

<p>The music halls are not more enlivening than are the
theatres, though the sight of an interior is worth the ten
<i>sen</i> fee, if only to see their manner of conducting the
opera. If you imagine the interior of a church, having
all its pews removed, leaving only the cant pieces on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>which they were erected, and the spaces between these
pieces covered and padded with the beautiful rice-straw
matting of the country, you will get a fairly good idea of
the simple fittings of a Japanese music hall. A whole
family seats itself in one of these squares; and as a
concert in this country is really a formidable affair, they
bring their braziers, teapots, and chow-boxes with them.
The performer&mdash;a lady&mdash;is seated, tailor fashion, on a
raised platform, a music desk in front of her, and her
musical instruments near at hand. The Japanese, like
the Chinese, sing from the throat, and the effect produced
on the tympanum is that of an amorous tom-cat chanting
to his lady-love at midnight. The words she is singing,
and has been singing for the&mdash;a friend who was with me
said "<i>the last week</i>;" but knowing him to be a joker, I
accept the statement with caution&mdash;for the last six hours,
and which she will probably continue to sing for the next
six, contain rather too much levity and grossness, could
we understand them, to be at all suitable even for sailors.
But her present audience receive them with the utmost
indifference, only betraying that they are at all conscious
of what is going on by an occasional clapping of the
hands. Now and again the singer has a spell and a libation
of saki, an attendant keeping her liberally supplied
in this item, of which she manages to drink a quantity
during her song; and, by way of a change at these
times, she enters into a monologue or a recitation. Taken
and viewed in an artistic light, the audience in their rich
gala dresses is a pleasing piece of color and of harmonic
contrasts.</p>

<p>Close to the temple a crowd is gathered around a horse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>box, in which is a milk-white steed&mdash;sacred, of course.
Before him a little table is placed, covered with tiny
saucers filled with beans; and the devout&mdash;and we in
particular&mdash;can have the puerile satisfaction of seeing him
munch his comfits in a strangely horselike manner for the
small sum of a "<i>sen</i>!" Near at hand are some more
sacred creatures&mdash;hundreds of turtles in a slimy pond rear
their snake-like heads through the thick green water for
the pieces of biscuit and little red balls of prepared food
which the children are constantly flinging into their midst.
These reptiles, it may be remembered, form an important
figure-subject in Japanese carvings, paintings, and bronzes.</p>

<p>Within easy distance of Kob&eacute;, and connected with it
by rail, are the cities of Osaca and Kioto, the former
being the seaport of the latter, and, possibly, the greatest
trade centre in the empire. It seems to be built at the
delta of a river; and as there are scores of bridges spanning
their several mouths, it has much the appearance of
Venice. Kioto is the sacred city of Japan, and contains,
amongst other interesting sights, a large temple, in which
are no fewer than 33,333 gods! Yearly pilgrimages are
made here; and to provide spiritual ministrations for the
thousands of pilgrims, it is said that the priests form one-fifth
of the entire population.</p>

<p>June 17th, to-day we completed with coal and started
for Yokohama, leaving the Inland Sea by its south eastern
entrance and entering on the broad bosom of the great
Pacific. By the help of a splendid breeze we are speedily
clear of the Linschoten strait and in view of a strange
picture, for giant Fusi begins to rear his hoary head above
the main.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>At first it appears but a small conical shaped island,
rising isolated from the midst of the sea, and which in a
few hours we shall reach. But a few hours multiply into
scores of hours, and still that island appears at a tantalizing
distance, and it is not until the main land comes into
view that we discover the misty island is no island at all,
but a superb mountain. It can be seen at an immense
distance from the sea; we, ourselves, are, at the very
least, sixty miles from its base, and yet how clearly
distinct, how tangibly present, how boldly out-lined it
stands against the opal tints of the evening sky.</p>

<p>Fusi-yama&mdash;"the peerless," "the matchless," or "the
unrivalled,"&mdash;is an extinct volcano, on the island of
Niphon, though, only a century since, it was in active
operation, and is said to have been brought into existence
in the space of a few days. Few sights are likely to leave
such an impression on one's mind, as solitary, graceful,
cold looking Fusi, which, clothed in a mantle of snow,
may, not inaptly, be compared to a grim sentinel guarding
the destinies of a nation. But who shall attempt a
description of its glories as we saw it that evening at sunset,
and many an evening afterward, with the chance and
transient effect of light and shade playing on its pearly
sides.</p>

<p>June 19.&mdash;The freshening gale soon rattled us past the
town of Simoda, and into the great bay of Yedo, with the
volcano of Vries at its entrance. Hundreds of queer-shaped
junks and smaller craft, laden with the produce of
the busy nation, glide across the rolling seas with duck-like
motions, on their peaceful mission to the capital.</p>

<p>I have before had occasion to mention these unintelligible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>pieces of naval architecture, but as they never
before appeared to me at such advantage as now, as they
struggle up the wind across our track, I have hitherto
refrained from saying much about them. They are constructed
very sharp forward and very broad aft, with high,
rising sterns something after the manner of the Chinese
junk, but far more picturesque and compact than the
sister country's vessel; and, so far as looks go, a far more
seaworthy craft than the latter. They carry an immense
sail of pure white canvas, save where a black cloth is let
in&mdash;for contrast perhaps&mdash;on the huge characters composing
the owner's name, mar its fair surface; and a stout,
heavy mast placed well abaft the centre of the vessel, and
curved at its upper end, the better to form an overhanging
derrick to hoist the sail by. The sail is made of any
number of cloths laced together vertically&mdash;not sewn&mdash;by
which method each cloth has a bellying property and
wrinkled appearance, independent of its neighbours, thus
the whole surface holds far more wind than one continuous
sheet would do. The vessels, despite their unnautical
appearance, sail well on a wind. Some writers have
affirmed, that instead of reefing as we do, and as is pretty
universal all over the world&mdash;namely, by reducing the
perpendicular height of the sail&mdash;that the Japanese
accomplish this by taking in sail <i>at the sides</i>, or laterally,
by unlacing a cloth at a time. This seems to me highly
absurd, and is certainly not borne out by the testimony of
my own observation; and that they should not conform to
the common usage of maritime nations&mdash;both savage
and civilized&mdash;in this particular is improbable. Even the
Chinese&mdash;who are generally admitted to be the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><i>unconforming</i> and irrational people in the world&mdash;reef
their sails, at least, in the orthodox way. Besides taking
a practical view of the matter, how are they in any sudden
emergency, and with their limited crews, to undo the
elaborate lacing, without going out on the yard and
climbing <i>down</i> the sail, unlacing as they go? So far as I
am able to judge, their method is a most simple and
effective one, for all that they do is to lower the sail,
gather in the slack at the bottom, and as there are several
sheets up and down the breech of the sail, the thing is
done with the utmost facility.</p>

<p>The build of a junk's stern is somewhat peculiar, for
there is a great hollow which, apparently, penetrates the
body of the vessel; a mode of construction said to be
due to an edict of one of the tycoons, to prevent his subjects
from leaving the country; for though it seems
incredible, these junks have been known to voyage to
India. The sampan has a similar faulty arrangement of
stern. Though the people obeyed the spirit of the law,
they evaded the letter of it by placing sliding watertight
boards across the aperture.</p>

<p>By noon we had anchored off Yokohama, now a large
and flourishing town, and the chief naval and foreign
trading port of Japan, though, before the English arrived
here in 1854, it was little more than a village.</p>

<p>Having got through the noise and smoke of salutes to
no less than four admirals, and other minor consular
expenditures of gunpowder, we prepared ourselves for a
pleasurable stay in the sailor's paradise. Perhaps no
place in the round of sailors' visits, certainly none on this
station, offers so many inducements, so many and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>pleasing channels of getting rid of money, as does Yokohama.
Certain it is that the officers, who form the banking
committee on board, never complain of being over
worked, during a ship's stay in this harbour, and plethoric
bank books are frequently reduced to a sad and pitiable
state of emaciation after having "done" Yokohama and
its vicinity.</p>

<p>The residences of the Europeans are situated out of the
town on a rising ground to the left, known as the Bluff.
Here the merchants live in rural magnificence, each with
his mansion surrounded by its own park-like grounds.
The English and foreign naval hospitals are also situated
in this healthy and beautiful spot; and it was here, too,
that our recent marine contingent to Japan had their
barrack.</p>

<p>The European concession is a small town in itself, and
from the nomenclature of the landing places it would
appear that the English and French claim the greatest
interests here. These landing stages are called, from the
division of the settlement which they front, the English
and French "<i>Hatobahs</i>"&mdash;the "<i>atter bar</i>" of the sailor.</p>

<p>As this town is the great point of contest between the
Japanese and the foreigner, everything in the shape of
"<i>curios</i>" can be obtained in its marts and bazaars. Most
of the objects are novel to us, and from their attractiveness
generally induce sailors to purchase on the strength
of that very quality. Except in very rare instances a
piece of real lacquer can scarcely be obtained, most of it
having already found its way to Europe; that which we
see here is made chiefly for sailors, who needs must take
something home&mdash;they care not what, nor are they very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>particular about the price asked. And how well these
people have studied the "tar;" how they have discovered
his weakness for startling colours! I am writing this
about four years subsequent to this, our first visit, and
one would think, that four years was amply sufficient for
the purpose of opening our eyes to deceptions. Have
they though? Not a bit of it, for we are quite as ready
to be "taken in" to-day or to-morrow, as we were four
years since. Still, there are some very handsome and,
now and then, really elegant things to be picked up in
the shops: bronzes, lacquers, china, tortoise-shell earrings,
fans, paintings, or silk, combining in their execution, the
most educated taste, and the most wonderful skill.
Generally speaking a "Japper" after naming a price will
rarely retract. The Chinaman always will, the rogue!
The Japanese know this peculiarity of the Chinaman, and
nothing will wound a Jap's self-respect more than to compare
his mode of dealing with the celestial's.</p>

<p>They seem to enjoy arguing and chaffering over prices,
and will frequently go to the length of pulling down
masses of paper, supposed to be invoices, to shew that
they are asking you fair. We pretend to examine these
inventories with a most erudite expression on our ignorant
faces, and invariably commence to open the wrong
end of the book, forgetful that the Japanese commence at
what we call the last page. The dealers display the
utmost indifference as to whether you buy or not, and
you may pull their shops to pieces without raising their
ire in the slightest, for they will bow to you just as ceremoniously
on leaving as though you had purchased twenty
dollars' worth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>Strange as Japanese art appears to us, there is design
in all their executions. This presents a marked contrast
to Chinese art, which appears to be simply the result of
the artist's fancy. A Chinaman seems to have no idea,
when he commences a thing, what he is going to produce,
he goes on cutting and scraping, taking advantage of, here
a vein in a stone, perhaps, or there a knot in the gnarled
branches of a tree, and his imagination, distorted by the
diabolical forms with which his superstition surrounds
him, does the rest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now I will ask you to take a run with me to Tokio,
the capital of Japan.</p>

<p>The hour's ride by rail conducts us through a pleasant,
well cultivated country. Fields of ripe grain, clusters of
woods with cottages peeping out of their bosky shades,
and surrounded by stacks of hay and corn, have, for the
Englishman, a farm-like and altogether a home-like look.</p>

<p>The best and safest method to adopt on arriving at the
terminus is to hire rickshas of the company at the railway
station, by so doing you are saved from being
victimised by the coolies, who are about as honest as the
Jehus of our own streets. You may employ them for as
many hours as you please, but to avoid fractions it is
usual to engage them by the day.</p>

<p>Until Japan was opened to foreigners, Tokio, or Yedo,
was a mystery to the civilized world. It was supposed to
be fabulously large, and was said to contain more inhabitants
than any other metropolis in the world; some accounts
putting it down to as many as four millions. As
regards its extent, the city certainly does cover an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>immense space. Its population, though, is but half that
of London. Its large area is due, perhaps, more to the
manner in which it is laid out, than to anything else&mdash;which
is in the form of concentric circles, the mikado's
palace, or castle, occupying the centre. Around this
dismal, feudal looking, royal abode, the various embassies
are erected; buildings which present a far finer&mdash;because
more modern and European&mdash;appearance than does the
imperial residence. Circling the whole is a large deep
moat, the waters of which are thickly studded with beautiful
water lilies, and spanned by several bridges. Then
come the dingy and now disused houses and streets of
those powerful men of a by-gone age, the daimios. The
whole aspect of this question may be summed up in the
word <i>desolation</i>. This, too, is surrounded by a canal, or
moat. Beyond this, again comes the city proper, with its
busy, bustling population.</p>

<p>We are entirely at the mercy of our "ricksha" men, and
have not the remotest idea of where they are driving us;
but assuming they know more about the city than we, this
does not exercise us much. They rattle us along over
unevenly paved streets, and whiz us around corners with
the rapidity of thought; an uncomfortable sensation in
the region of the dorsal vertebr&aelig;, resulting from the
unusual bumping process, and a fear lest, haply, we may
be flying out of our carriage at a tangent into somebody's
shop front, a pleasing reflection should we take a header
amongst china.</p>

<p>Our coolies had been directed to a quarter of the city
called Shiba, and here at length we find ourselves, and
are shortly set down before one of the grandest buddhist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>temples in Japan. How peacefully the great building
reposes in its dark casket of solemn fir trees! To reach
the main entrance, we traverse a broad pathway lined
with praying lanterns on either hand. These lanterns are
stone pedestals, surmounted by a hollow stone ball with a
crescent shaped aperture in its surface, through which, at
night, the rays of light proceeding from <i>burning prayers</i>
penetrate the gloom. Scores of tombs, containing the
remains of the defunct tycoons and their wives, fill the
temple court; and as each successive tycoon looked forward
to reposing here after death, during life he richly
embellished it, and endeavoured to make it worthy to
receive so august a body as his own.</p>

<p>A bald-headed priest, standing at the great entrance,
bids us remove our shoes and follow him. He conducts
us up grand stair cases, through corridors, into courtyards,
chapels, and sanctuaries; unlocks recesses, and
produces sacred vessels of massive gold work of vast
antiquity and splendid design, intimating to us that these
are for the sole use of the mikado, when he assumes his
priestly office. Here we get our first idea of what real
lacquer means. Our bonze brought out a small lacquered
cubical box, of a dull gold colour, and about four inches
in height, and gave us to understand that it could not be
purchased for 500 dollars! Just fancy! And then the
carving, gilding, colouring, and lacquer, everywhere, is
something beyond description. Even the very floors on
which we tread, the stairs, the hand-rails, are all gorgeous
with vermilion lacquer. One sanctuary is really resplendent,
its vessel's mouldings and ornaments being of dead
gold work, wrought in all kinds of emblematical designs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>and shapes. I feel assured that no thoughtful man can
visit Shiba's temple without being impressed with the high
perfection to which the Japanese have attained in the arts;
a perfection which the foreign mind can rarely grasp.
After a donation to the polite bonze&mdash;which he receives
on a gold salver and lays on the altar&mdash;we encase our
feet in leather once more, and leave the sacred precincts.
We may possibly never have the opportunity of paying
Shiba a second visit; but the privilege of having done so
once is&mdash;to a man of research&mdash;a liberal education in
itself.</p>

<p>The streets and their busy throng are very gay and
lively. Hosts of healthy-looking and prettily clad
children are running here, there, and everywhere in
pursuit of their kites, and other childish amusements.
Vendors hawking their wares, as at home; the shrill
melancholy whistle of the blind shampooer who, with a
staff in one hand and a short bamboo pipe in the other,
thus apprises people of his willingness to attend on them;
ladies bowing and "sayonaraing" each other in musical
tones; the encouraging voice of the driver to his jaded
ox; and the warning "a&mdash;a" of the <i>ricksha</i> man; these
are the music of the streets in "the land of the rising
sun."</p>

<p>The city can boast in the possession of several very
fine and extensive parks, that in which the Naval College
is situate being one of the largest. Here the youthful
Japanese officers of the navy were educated by English
instructors in all the branches and requirements of the
modern naval service, and some of the work we saw in
the different parts of the building shews that the Japanese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>have become thorough masters of the technicalities, and
no mean adepts at their practical application. All the
foreign instructors&mdash;except one&mdash;have now been discharged,
the Japanese feeling themselves strong enough
to walk alone in naval matters. That one exception is a
chief gunner's mate, who so rarely uses the English
language that, on conversing with us, he had frequently
to pause to consider what words he should make use of,
and even then his English was broken, and spoken just as
a native would speak it.</p>

<p>On the return ride to Yokohama I was fortunate enough
to find myself seated next a gentleman who has been
resident in Japan upwards of twenty-five years, during
which period he has travelled throughout the length and
breadth of the empire. As may be imagined he was a
repository of much valuable and varied information. He
could hoist out facts and figures as easily as you would
fling a weevily biscuit to leeward. From his conversation
with me I gained much knowledge about Japan, which it
was impossible I could have acquired in any other way,
and all of which I have embodied in various parts of this
narrative.</p>

<p>The manner in which the natural taste is assimilating
itself to European ideas appears more evident when one
comes to observe the hundreds of Japanese who take
advantage of the railway. Stop at what station you like,
you will find the platform suddenly alive with gaily dressed
and clogged passengers, on pleasure bent, loaded with
toys or wares that have been purchased, in the gay
capital.</p>

<p>A few days after the above events the Japanese squadron
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>of smart corvettes, and the large ironclad "Foo-soo"
(Great Japan, as we say Great Britain,) got under way and
proceeded to sea. It was rumoured that the mikado was
to have accompanied in his yacht, and in anticipation of
his embarkation all the men-of-war in harbour dressed
ship, though, as it turned out, he did not put in an
appearance.</p>

<p>July 3rd.&mdash;General Grant arrived this morning in the
corvette "Richmond," and escorted by a Japanese man-of-war.
All ships, except the English and German, dressed
in honour of the American flag, which the corvette flew at
her main. The two nationalities I have mentioned seem
to have offered a marked discourtesy to the general, the
German especially so, for just as the "Richmond" was
about to anchor the "Prinz Adalbert" broke the German
royal standard at her royal mast head, which, as it were,
blew the charges out of guns already loaded for the
American. The "Adalbert" has Prince Heinrich, the
second son of our Princess Royal, on board as a
midshipman; hence the standard.</p>

<p>It would appear that the slight passed on Jonathan
did not go entirely unnoticed by him, for in the evening,
at sunset, when, as is customary with that nation, her
band played her colours down and then the national
anthems, it was noticed that the English and German
tunes were studiously omitted.</p>

<p>But the "Richmond" had taken up a bad billet to
anchor in, and to find a more secure one she steamed out
to the entrance of the harbour and made a wide sweep
before returning. Some of our jocular shipmates had
quite a different view of this proceeding, for, if we are to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>believe them, the American went out to take the turn out
of her flags, or to allow her ship's company to bathe, the
waters of the harbour being too shallow for the latter
purpose!</p>

<p>Unwillingly my pen has once again to trace the lines
which are to record the death of another of our poor
fellows, Frederick Smyth, a stoker. Returning from leave
in one of the open, dangerous, shallow boats of the place,
and perhaps slightly the worse for liquor, the unfortunate
man fell overboard, his body not being recovered until
some days after the sad event.</p>

<p>July 22nd.&mdash;Up anchor once more! Onward is our
motto, nor are we particularly sorry to be on the move,
for I think everybody is surfeited with Yokohama, and
perhaps the fact that everybody's money is all gone, has
something to do with our eagerness to be off. So, boys,
"We'll go to sea for more," as the old tars did. Just as
the anchor was a-trip two royal personages came on board,
the Princes Arisugawa&mdash;father and son; the father being
the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army; the son a
"midshipmite" in the Imperial navy. They were
attended by their suite and Sir Harry Parkes, the British
ambassador at Tokio. We took them a short distance
to sea with us, and after seeing one or two evolutions
they returned to Yokohama in the "Vigilant," whilst we
resumed our voyage.</p>

<p>Shortly after rounding Mela Head and shaping
our course to the northward, the temperature underwent
a marked change, in fact so suddenly were we
ushered into a colder zone that everybody is on the
search for pocket handkerchiefs, these articles being in
very general demand.</p>

<p>The eastern coast of Niphon, along which we are now cruising,
has several admirable harbours and sheltered
anchorages. Two days after leaving Yokohama we found
the ship standing in for the land and making for
Yamada, one of the securest harbours on the coast.
Bold hills and headlands, clothed in the easily recognisable
dark green foliage of the fir, rear themselves on either
hand as we pass into the outer bay. This outer sheet of
water&mdash;for there is an inner&mdash;has a very broad opening
seaward, but suddenly, on changing course, a narrow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>inlet reveals a noble bay, perfectly land-locked with a
village of considerable size at its head. No sooner had
our anchor left the bows than a volunteer party asked and
obtained permission to go fishing. So far, however, as
catching fish was concerned, the expedition was a signal
failure, though, looked at in the light of enjoyment, it
was a perfect success. Along the beach of this arcadia
an abundance of flowers grow in a wild state, amongst
them the rose, whose beauty, bloom, and fragrance
equalled those of the choicest culture in our English
garden; and on looking at them and the other familiar
flowers around, we might have been forgiven for fancying
ourselves at home. Whence come our associates,
and why is it that even the fragrance of a flower is
capable of seizing hold on the mind, and transporting it
to the utmost limits of a continent?</p>

<p>The usual wondering throng of natives speedily gathered
around us, eager to participate in the viands which we were
endeavouring to stow away. Fortunately we had plenty
of biscuit with which to satisfy their curiosity; but it was
a long time before they could be prevailed upon to drink
out of a basin of cocoa. When we offered it to them
they touched their heads and swayed their bodies to and
fro, making a very creditable pantomime of intoxication.
At length, however, one of us used the Japanese word
"<i>tcha</i>" (tea) which had the desired effect, for one man
advanced, took a drink, and liked it; and though he of
course discovered it was not tea, he also found out it was
not rum.</p>

<p>July 27th&mdash;We have now reached the northern end of
Niphon, and turned westward into the broad strait of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>Tsugar, which separates the greater island from Yesso.
The scenery about the strait is very lovely; all day we
have coasted the land down, and alternate hill and dale,
and here and there a giant volcano peak were most
refreshing objects on which to rest the eye. Towards
evening the great open bay of Awomori came into view,
and in a short time we had entered it, and cast anchor
opposite a small town, built on a level grassy plain. The
irregularly scattered houses, amidst trees and greensward,
have something the appearance of Singapore, when
viewed from the seaward.</p>

<p>Our stay was but short, for on the following morning
our anchor was at the bows, and the ships heading for
Hakodadi. This town&mdash;the largest in Yesso&mdash;reminds
one very forcibly of Gibraltar. There is a similar high
rock standing sheer out of the sea&mdash;almost the same
narrow strip of land connecting it with the main; whilst
the town is built on the slopes of the eminence, and
circling the bay as at Gib. The town is not over large,
and commodities are very scarce, the only thing obtainable
being dried salmon.</p>

<p>During our stay the ship's company landed under arms&mdash;a
by no means pleasurable treat, as you shall see.
The waters near the shore were so shallow that the men
experienced great difficulty in reaching the beach, and
were only able to accomplish it after wading through
about twenty yards of mud and water, dragging guns and
ammunition with them. Add to this the inconvenience
of drilling and marching in dripping clothes, and the
knowledge that the same performance must be repeated
to embark again; and you will see that a sailor's life is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>not all sugar. Hakodadi is not a place that sailors are
likely to fall in love with, for there is no accommodation
on shore for them; yet leave was given, and the men had
to "bunk it out" where they could. On this occasion&mdash;let me
record it in the reddest of red letters, or in the
most emphatic italics&mdash;<i>a liberty boat was granted</i>.</p>

<p>August 3rd&mdash;To-day is Sunday, and a sort of preliminary
inspection by the admiral, but&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;he
completely ignored the beautifully cleaned deck and
stanchions, the glistening whitewash, and all the other aids
to appearances, well known to sailors, and put on specially
for the occasion! Yes, he actually took not the slightest
notice of these, but, instead, poked his head into all the
holes and corners where he was likely to find sundry and
various small gear, such as dirty towels, "duff" bags,
ditty bags, and so forth. The result might have been
anticipated. He turned out so much that, before he had
gone a third of the way around the lower deck, he gave
the captain orders to make a personal inspection first, and
then report to him; and as everyone knows, when once
Captain Cleveland gets into that canvas suit of his, he is&mdash;in
naval phrase&mdash;"a dead rivet."</p>

<p>One night, as we lay here ready for sea, a man-of-war
was observed entering the harbour, and as soon as the
flashing lights were brought to bear, and her number
made, she proved to be the "Charybdis," last from Yokohama.
She informed us that, subsequent to her leaving
that port, cholera had broken out amongst her crew, one
man having died of it on the passage, whilst a second was
down with the disease, though he was now in a fair way
towards recovery. She was at once ordered into quarantine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>and to hoist the "yellow jack" at the fore. Young
Prince Arisugawa was also on board, taking passage to
join our ship as naval cadet; however, he was not permitted
to come to us until he had been overhauled by the
doctors on shore, and his clothes fumigated. Immediately
he had left her the "Charybdis" was ordered to sea; the
bracing sea air of a more northern clime being about the
most effective medicine for her crew.</p>

<p>August 9.&mdash;To-day Prince Arisugawa came on board,
and in due course was consigned to the tender mercies of
the young English gentlemen in the gunroom; his future
messmates&mdash;and shall I be wrong if I say <i>tormentors</i>? At
the same time a most acceptable gift to the ship's company,
consisting of eight bullocks, was brought alongside; the
present, I believe, of the Emperor, whose health we <i>ate</i>
next day.</p>

<p>Steam was already up when the prince embarked, and
there was nothing further to detain us except the weather.
That, indeed, was very threatening, and not to be ignored.
Terrific peals of thunder and blinding lightning, accompanied
by such heavy and persisted showers of rain that
it was a mystery how the soil could withstand such an inundation,
delayed our sailing for upwards of four hours.
At the end of that time nature again resumed her wonted
smiling appearance, the sun chasing away such evidences
of bad temper with the rapidity of thought.</p>

<p>Nothing of moment occurred on our voyage up the
gulf of Tartary, except that, during one middle watch, the
ship narrowly escaped running on a rock; but as she did
not actually touch, we verify the adage that "a miss is as
good as a mile." The day following, the lifting of a fog
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>bank revealed to us the "Charybdis" close in shore, under
small sail. On signalling us that she had pitched her late
unwelcome visitor overboard, she was allowed to join
company, and afterwards proceeded on to Dui, to coal and
order some for us.</p>

<p>August 13th.&mdash;Sad misfortune! direful calamity! Why?
Read, and you will be as wise as myself. In the middle
watch of this night, our two cats&mdash;have I told you
that we brought two cats from England with us?&mdash;as
was their wont, were skylarking and cutting capers on the
hammock nettings and davits, when tabby the lesser, instead
of jumping on something palpable, made a leap on
space with the natural result, for he lighted on water and
was rapidly whirled astern by the inky waters of the
Tartar gulf. Poor pussy, little did we dream, or you
either, that Siberian waters were to sing your requiem!
We feel very sorry at the loss of our pet, for he was a
thorough sailor, thinking it nothing to mount the rigging
and seat himself on the crosstrees, whilst on his rounds;
and as to the item "rats," shew me the rodent that could
ever boast of weathering him, and I will shew you a
clever beast.</p>

<p>At daybreak we made the harbour of Dui, in the island
of Saghalien, a Russian penal settlement and coaling
dep&ocirc;t, though coaling is under such severe restrictions
that the trouble to secure it is worth its cost. For
instance, only a certain number of tons can be had each
day, and then only for one ship at a time; and instead of
using large lighters to bring it off, small boats are employed,
rendering it necessary to make a multiplicity of
visits to the shore. This island, until recently a part of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>the Japanese empire, is rich in coal, and other minerals, a
fact Russia was careful to note when casting her covetous
eyes over its broad surface.</p>

<p>It may be remembered, perhaps, that in the year 1879,
Russia sent her first batch of Nihilists and other political
offenders to Siberia, by the more expeditious sea route,
and that alarming reports had crept into the European
press, and especially into that of the national censor, the
English, as to the cruelties and inhumanities these poor
people had to endure on the voyage. The vessel, with the
convicts on board, was lying at Dui on our arrival, and
our admiral was not slow to avail himself of the means of
satisfying himself, and, through him, the English press, as
to the alleged enormities. He found, I believe, that far
from being badly treated, the prisoners had every consideration
allowed them consistent with their position as
state prisoners. Indeed, the convicts on this island seem
to enjoy almost perfect liberty of action, short of being
permitted to escape, for I encountered about a score of
them on shore&mdash;big, burly, well-fed fellows&mdash;smoking,
playing at pitch-and-toss, and singing, as if to be a convict
was a state to be desired rather than otherwise. Possibly,
these were good characters, for I certainly saw some in
the coaling hulks with heavy chains on their wrists and
legs, and with half-shaved heads&mdash;a distinguishing mark
which those I met on shore had not.</p>

<p>By dint of extra pressure we managed to procure our
coal next day, though it took us till after sundown to get
in 140 tons. We and the "Charybdis" then sailed&mdash;she
for Yokohama and we for Castries bay&mdash;about sixty miles
on the other side of the gulf&mdash;where we dropped anchor
on the following morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>We felt the weather bitterly cold, as contrasted with the
temperature of our experience since leaving England,
though, I suppose, at home such would be called genial.</p>

<p>There is not a sign or semblance of the human species,
near this spot. All around us is forest, forest to the utmost
limit of vision. Pines and firs, firs and pines, for
acres upon acres; sufficient, I should think, to furnish all
the navies of the world, present and yet unborn, with
spars. What a solemn and wintry aspect these northern
forests have; what weird murmurs and ghostly sighs
haunt their virgin glades. Sometimes in the midst of this
almost black greenness, some forest monarch, bleached
and scared by the icy breath of generations of Siberian
winters, stands out with skeleton distinctness. A dreary,
desolate place altogether. There must be a town somewhere
in the vicinity, though, for in the afternoon the
military commandant hove in sight. This official had on
the enormous bearskin head-dress, and dark green uniform
of the Cossack regiment. An insignificant-looking
man, all moustache and swagger.</p>

<p>On Monday, the day following our arrival, to all those
who cared to avail themselves of it, a regular day's outing
was granted. We started early, so as to have a long day
before us. We had permission to fish to our heart's content,
in waters where fish is specially abundant and good.
It was rather a long pull to the shore, and shallow water
there when we reached it, for we had gone a considerable
distance up a small river. The town (so it is called) of
Alexandrovsk&mdash;at the same time the village of "Tighee"
(Torpoint) would make four such towns&mdash;was passed on
our way up. We pushed on into the interior as far as we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>could drag our larger boats, and selected our encampment
on a spit of beach, near the dwellings of some natives.
These huts were of tent shape and constructed of bark,
and covered with the skins of the reindeer, numbers of
which animals we can see grazing in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this little-known part of the great
asiatic continent, are mongolian Tartars. They are possessed
of a rather forbidding cast of feature, have great
square, flat faces, the nose scarcely distinguishable, and
swallowed up in the flattening process (this though, by
the way, is an index of beauty amongst them), low foreheads,
and dreamy-looking obliquely-set eyes. Their
head-gear is much after the Chinese style, except, that in
addition to the queue, they allow the remainder of the
hair to develop itself, which it does in the wildest and
most elfish manner. For dress, the untanned skins of the
animals caught in the chase, with the hair outboard,
answers all their requirements. At first one experiences a
great difficulty in distinguishing the sexes, for the ordinary
bearings by which we sight "danger" ahead are entirely
wanting. Stay, are they <i>all</i> absent? Scarcely, for the
vanity inherent in woman displays itself even here. These
ladies have large <i>iron</i> rings in their ears, and through the
cartilage of the nose a similar pendant is hung, on which
is an additional ornament of a green stone, much resembling
the mineral malachite. Their dress is a very capacious,
continuous garment of the yellow skin of the hair
seal, seamed with sinews, and very rudely put together.
Hundreds of yelping dogs lay about in all possible
attitudes of laziness, whilst a few other village pets, <i>e.g.</i>, a
great bald-headed eagle, of a most bloodthirsty and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>ferocious aspect, and a couple of large brown bears with
uncomfortable looking teeth and arms, suggestive of a
long embrace, stood unpleasantly near, though their
owners had thought fit to secure them.</p>

<p>This people's religion is a strange mixture of heathenism
and Greek church Christianity. The czar's soldiers
have a very short and effective manner of converting the
subjugated races which bow before their swords, by
driving the whole batch at the point of the bayonet into
the nearest stream, whilst a little Greek cross is put round
the neck of each, and a copy of the bible given them.
Near these huts I observed an idol of the rudest construction.
It was supposed, I presume, to represent a man's
shape&mdash;but it was merely a flat board, with the lower end
sharpened to a point to fix in the ground, and the upper
end fashioned into a very ambiguous circle to form a
head; the mouth, nose, and eyes being afterwards added
in pigment. One old gent pulled from some obscure
retreat in the internal structure of his ample ulster, a
pocket edition of the Acts of the Apostles, in English, and
from the careful manner in which it was preserved, and
the security of its hiding place, he seemed to set great
store by it. I tried to surmise how such a volume could
have come into his possession, and could only account
for it by supposing it had washed up on the beach; but
then, if so, why such reverential care of the book. Missionaries,
say you. Well, a missionary would scarcely
provide himself with copies of the English scripture for
distribution amongst gilyaks and calmuck Tartars.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our fishers had pushed on still further
inland, dragging the dingy after them, and had met with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>such success that they returned to camp with their boat
laden to the gunwale with salmon and salmon trout. But
of all the fish taken that day, by far the finest specimen
was that captured near the camping ground. This was a
magnificent salmon, of over forty pounds weight, that
had become entangled in the long grass with which the
surface of the river was covered, a circumstance which
rendered him an easy prey to his enemies.</p>

<p>Resuming our southward voyage, our next place of call
was Barracouta harbour. It was here, if I am rightly
informed, that a French naval officer shot himself,
because he had allowed the Russian squadron to overreach
him. It was during the Crimean war, the English
and French squadrons had hunted the station all over to
come up with the Russians, but though they often sighted
the enemy, they never succeeded in engaging them. From
China to Japan, from Japan to Corea, and away in
Siberian waters, it was all the same; the Russians were
perfectly successful in out man&oelig;uvring their enemy. At
length the squadron was again sighted, and their capture
seemed a dead certainty, when suddenly it disappeared
into a small inlet, apparently in the iron-bound coast
of Kamtschatka. Without charts, or the remotest knowledge
of the locality, it would be madness to follow. The
British, indeed, did manage to find their way into
Petropoloski, and succeeded, I believe, in setting fire to
one old hulk. It was a most inglorious business throughout,
and so worked on the exciteable temperament of the
French commanding officer, that he decided to die by his
own hand rather than survive such a questionable victory.</p>

<p>On entering the harbour we observed the "Pegasus" at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>anchor, seemingly in a wilderness of fir trees. This is
the first time we have seen this smart little sloop, as she is
a recent addition to our fleet.</p>

<p>There is an abundance of wild fruits here; the raspberries,
in particular, being specially fine in size, and
delicious in flavour. These and sloes were the only two
we recognised, and we took especial care to go in for none
of the others; wisely deciding that it was better to confine
ourselves to the known. After traversing a virgin forest&mdash;soft, mossy, and velvety to the naked feet&mdash;and now and
again wading muddy streams, studded with artificial
islets, composed of roots and other <i>debris</i>&mdash;in fact floating
islands&mdash;we at length came out into a clearing, in which
was a collection of huts, and a number of women engaged
in the preparation of fish, but for what purpose I am to this
day ignorant. The manner in which they set about their
work is most revolting. Unpleasant though I know it will
look in print, nevertheless it must be described. Each
woman is armed with a sharp, crescent-shaped blade&mdash;seemingly
of steel&mdash;with which she makes an incision in
the back of the neck of the fish, sufficiently deep to penetrate
the skin; then taking the animal in both her hands,
and applying her teeth to the wound, she tears a long
strip off towards the tail, which disappears down her
throat with the rapidity and movements of an eel, or of
macaroni "down the neck" of a Neapolitan beggar. This,
I presume, is called the tit-bit, for the remainder is thrown
on one side into a pit, amongst a heap of putrid, festering
fish, to undergo the rotting process, necessary to a perfect
cure. The appetite of these squaws seem unsatiable; for
during the short time we looked on, three of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>managed to get outside of about twenty salmon trout, in
this manner.</p>

<p>After a stay of three days in this pretty little spot, we
started, under very unfavourable circumstances. The
weather was very cold and foggy, and rain fell in abundance,
so altogether it was very unpleasant. But this was
not all, for on making the open sea the wind began to rise,
and we close to a lee shore. We speedily prepared for a
gale, as night was coming on, and no indications of the
wind going down. The "Pegasus" was still in company;
and the two ships kept up a pretty lively conversation
with each other during that night of fog, by means of that
nautical toy, the steam whistle. Fast and furious they
went at it, singing sweet lullabys to the slumbering tars of
the watch below. Such horrible shrieks and appalling
yells would startle a Red-Indian war-whoop into fits. I
feel certain, from subsequent remarks on the subject&mdash;let
fall in the manner peculiar to seamen&mdash;that if their wishes
had been answered that night, all the waters in the sea
would not have been sufficient to cool the place where
they would have consigned the whole apparatus.</p>

<p>At daybreak, the little patch of blue up aloft that
mariners so delight to see, shewed us hopes of a fine day.
Shortly afterwards we observed a Russian corvette
standing out from the land, having just left the anchorage
we are about to visit, namely, Olga bay, another fine
harbour on the Siberian seaboard. Here we found the
Russian admiral, the "Vigilant," and an Italian frigate&mdash;the
"Vittor Pisani." From hence the "Pegasus" was
despatched to Nagasaki, whilst we and the "Vigilant"
headed for Vladivostock, calling at Nayedznik bay on the
way, and anchoring for the night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>We made three or four attempts to start in the morning,
but each time were compelled to delay our departure,
out of respect for the heavy fogs which would gather so
rapidly in our vicinity. When at length we did get outside,
things did not improve, by which we infer that the maritime
region of Siberia is a dangerous one at this season.
However we steamed along at a pretty brisk rate, and by
10 a.m. had the satisfaction of seeing Vladivostock open
out before us. This town is Russia's principal seaport
and naval station in this part of her dominions&mdash;the head
quarters of her navy, and the great military dep&ocirc;t. It has
an extremely pleasant appearance from the harbour. On
going on shore, though, and examining things in detail I
saw that the houses which looked so charming from the
ship were constructed of rough unhewn logs of timber,
the crevices being filled up with mud. The inhabitants
are principally Russian, of course&mdash;soldiers and sailors,
with their wives; but, in addition, there are Coreans,
Chinese, and a few (very few) Japanese. The Russian
women are coarse and masculine in appearance, are
dressed in cotton print gowns put on very slovenly, wear
no covering on the head except their unkempt and dishevelled
hair, ride on horseback like a man, and have
their feet and legs encased in enormous sea-boots. Everybody
wears these leather boots just as everyone is an
equestrian. Even the officers' wives have a slovenly,
faded look; and I can honestly say that I never saw one
amongst them whom, from her appearance, I should style
a lady. There is scarcely a street or road in the place,
and the only thoroughfare is that suggested by the deep
and sloppy ruts made by the heavy lumbering cart and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>the uncomfortable <i>drosky</i>&mdash;the latter a four-wheeled concern
peculiar to Russia, possessing a couple of seats
running fore and aft, and so near the ground that the
passengers' feet are in imminent danger of being brought
in contact with stray stones and other inequalities.</p>

<p>In a town such as this one would expect to find commodities
both reasonable in price and plenty in variety.
Not so, however; what little business there is in the provision
line is in the hands of the "ubiquitous"&mdash;I mean
the Chinaman. Lemonade is a thing unknown, and none
of us was bold enough to tackle that vile brew&mdash;Russian
beer. Of course, like all salt water fish, after being on
shore for a short time we wanted "damping;" but there
seemed no possibility of our wants being understood, as,
seemingly, nobody could speak English. Now, when the
British seaman particularly wants anything to drink, and
can't get it, he generally uses language which (all things
considered) is rather more forcible than polite&mdash;that is to
say, we would not care for ladies to hear it. It was so
here. Vladivostock was this, that, and the other, garnished
with sundry and manifold adjectives; in fact it was anything
but a town. I dare say, had our sailors the least
inkling that all this while they were listened to and understood,
they would have reserved some of their more choice
figures of speech. It was so, however; for suddenly
somebody asked, in splendid English, "Do you require
anything, gentlemen?" Our interrogator was a Russian
military officer, with several ribbons and crosses on his
broad breast. We stated our difficulty, and he very
politely directed us to a French hotel, and even accompanied
us part of the way. I certainly was not prepared
to hear English spoken so well by a Rooski.</p>

<p>August 31st.&mdash;At the early hour of four this
morning the shrill sound of those ear-piercing
instruments, the boatswains' pipes in combination,
resounded clearly and distinctly in the pure raw air, as
"all hands" summoned the sleepy crew to heave up
anchor. In less than an hour, thanks to the modern
sailors' help, the steam capstan, our white wings were
spread for the expected breeze outside the harbour. As
yet, however, the wind has not been enticed, it being, as
one of our shipmates from the sister isle put it, "a dead
calm, with what wind there was dead ahead." Further
on we overhauled a splendid breeze, which caused our
canvas to strain in every fibre as we careened to its pressure.
This gave us such material help that by noon of
next day we had carved a good big slice out of the six
hundred miles to Nagasaki.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>September 3rd.&mdash;From the greasy appearance of the
moon last night, and from a study of other varied phenomena
whereby sailors, from time immemorial, have
learnt to forecast the weather, we "smelt" a change of
some sort was about to happen; and we sleepers, on turning
out in the morning, were in no wise surprised to find
that the wind had headed us, that all the sails were furled,
and the ship poking her nose into a nasty sea. But this
was a blind: the clerk of the weather was evidently meditating
a stronger blow from the original direction, and
had only gone on ahead to seek some of his refractory
forces to give us the full benefit of the combination. All
sail again, fast and furious we drove through it, and succeeded
in knocking "seven and a bit" out of the old
"Duke;" 'twould take something like a hurricane to persuade
her to more. We tore past Tsu-sima, an island in
the Corea strait, and laughingly cleared the run down to
Nagasaki.</p>

<p>September 4th.&mdash;As information had reached us at
Vladivostock that cholera was raging pretty freely at
Nagasaki, instead of proceeding at once to the anchorage
we brought up at the mouth of the harbour, under the lee
of Tacabuco, until such times as we should hear more
definite and accurate accounts of the extent of the
enemy's depredations. Like another much-libelled personage,
who is often painted much blacker than he perhaps
is, the cholera, through undoubtedly present, was confined
to the poorer haunts of the city, so that with necessary
precautions there was nothing to fear. Stopping everybody's
leave, though, unfortunately happened to be a
necessary precaution, and communication with the shore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>was limited to the visits of the bumboat and washermen.</p>

<p>On the following morning we commenced to fill up with
coal. I have before remarked that in this port we have
lady coal heavers. It so chanced that for once they were
rather short-handed, and to expedite the work a party of
blue-jackets were sent to clear a spare lighter. Whether or
not they mistook the commander's order, or whether their
eyes had got blinded with coal dust I can't say, but sure
am I that they failed, every man-jack of them, to go into
the indicated boat. May be, the sight of women at
"unwomanly work" was too much for Jack's chivalry&mdash;at
any rate, they had jumped in among the women and were
cheerfully heaving out the coal whilst the latter bad a
smoke. Now this, however laudable in itself, was clearly
not the commander's intention, and the gallants, much
against their will, had to yield to pressure and clear the

<p>September 7th.&mdash;In company with the "Growler" and
"Sylvia" we left the shores of fair Nagasaki; and after
despatching the small fry about their business we shaped
our course for Chefoo. The wind for a short distance
was again fair; but having, presumably, discovered its
mistake, and that we had had a full share of his favors
lately, old boisterous suddenly changed his tactics, and
intimated to us in unmistakable language, by alternate
lulls and squalls, that he was about to do something rash.
At noon of the second day out, after, we must confess,
ample warning, he had apparently decided what to do,
the wind came up as foul as it could well be. We were at
this time off the island of Quelpart, still carrying reduced
sail and barely going our course.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>The breeze, though strong, was steady and all went
well until the ship reached the western extremity of the
mountainous island, when, with a roar and a screech truly
terrific, a squall struck us in wild, fitful gusts. We were
carrying reefed topsails and trysails at the time, and it was
fortunate that we had no more sail on, or surely our spars
must have gone over the side. As it was, the fore trysail
split with the report of a cannon, and the main-topsail,
unable to stand the enormous strain, was torn from top to
bottom. To make things more cheerful, the clouds, in
their sport, hurled blinding slanting sheets of water at us;
for it would be an error to say that rain fell. An effort
was made to furl sails; but though there was no lack of
cheerful hands speedily on the yards, numbers became
powerless to manipulate canvas which by the combined
elements had been converted into deal boards. As it was
impossible that orders could be heard from deck, the
officers went aloft and lay out on the yards amongst the
men, encouraging them by voice and example. The
attempt had to be given up and the sails secured to the
yards by lashings.</p>

<p>September 11th.&mdash;The dreary, monotonous, unenlivening
coast line of China, with its interminable sand hills
and granite peaks, once more in sight. The landscapes
of north China are, if anything, more dreary than ever.
We must however take the bad with the good. Chefoo
lies before us, and into Chefoo we are bound to go. We
cannot, as yet, see any town, because of a sort of natural
breakwater of sand and rocks which stretches almost
across the harbour's mouth; but that there is an anchorage
beyond is clear, from the thousands of masts pointing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>skyward. So slow was our progress into the harbour that
it seemed as if we were never going to get there at all;
but eventually we dropped anchor at about three miles
from what I suppose pretends to be a town, but which
from such a distance looked more like a straggling village.
We had gone in quite far enough, though, for every revolution
of the screws discoloured the water with sand and
mud, and, furthermore, I believe we touched, for a distinct
not to be mistaken vibration was clearly felt by all
hands. This part of the anchorage is much exposed to
the sea; and, in the event of a blow from the northward,
we are in a position to encounter its full fury. Chefoo,
notwithstanding its uninteresting appearance, seems to be
a pretty regular port of call for men-of-war, several of
which are lying at anchor within the bar.</p>

<p>There must be some spots in the neighbourhood capable
of cultivation, for our bumboat is loaded with an
abundance of tempting fruits&mdash;grapes of rich bloom and
large growth, apples which would do no discredit to a
West of England orchard, and peaches scarcely inferior to
those v of the Mediterranean. And how cheap everything
is&mdash;eggs you can get for the asking almost, whilst a whole
fowl (prepared and cooked in a manner which, out of
charity to the Chinese culinary art, we wont pry into too
closely, but which our sailor gourmands relish nevertheless)
is obtainable for five cents! I refer, of course, to that
bird which our shipmates denominate "<i>dungaree chicken</i>."
Our first impression of Chefoo is that it is the place of all
others on the station to send emaciated ships' companies
to regain their stamina.</p>

<p>The district has a special manufacture of silk, much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>prized by our female friends at home, made from the fibres
of the bamboo. Did you ever see such a wonderful plant
as that same bamboo? I could not enumerate half the
uses to which the natives of China and Japan apply its
beautiful slender golden stem. The silk, of a color resembling
brown holland, is really very good, and makes
excellent summer out-door dresses for the European ladies
and girls at Chefoo. Some of the best costumes I noticed
on shore were made of this material.</p>

<p>Shortly after our arrival the "Vigilant" came in, en
route for Tientsin, a port further up the Gulf of Pe-chili,
and to the westward of us. You may perhaps remember
that it was here the recent massacre of some helpless
French sisters of mercy took place, an event which at
one time seemed very likely to have embroiled China into
a war with France.</p>

<p>I wonder if I should be wrong in saying that one of
the principal reasons which makes this so desirable a port
for navy ships is the advantages presented by the sand-bar
at the mouth of the harbour for shore evolutions? This
may or may not be so; but scarcely a week passed
without our captain taking us ashore to play at soldiers,
and sometimes two or even three times a week. The bar
has many qualities suitable for military operations; a
rocky grass-covered mound at the western extremity in
particular forming an excellent position for the field guns
and assaulting parties. This spot will be always remembered
by our ship's company by the name of Fort Cleveland,
a name they themselves bestowed on it, because the
captain, who conducted these landing parties with strict
regard to military tactics, so frequently made it the culminating
point in the day's man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>After all it was deemed advisable to shift out of our
present unsafe anchorage to a more secure one inside the
bar, and, as the "Modeste" was about to leave for Chusan,
she came alongside and took us in tow. We have met
with no heavy weather here yet; but we shall be fortunate
indeed if we don't get a "brew" at this season.</p>

<p>We had been here somewhere about ten days when the
Chinese governor came on board, attended, as is the
custom in China, by a numerous suite of lesser mandarins
and their retainers. Chefoo is an important military command,
as well as one of the chief naval ports in the
empire; hence the governor is a high military mandarin.
From the governor downwards they were all dressed
pretty much alike. The mandarins were distinguishable
only by a button, worn on the top of their mushroom hats.
The colour and material of this button, like the "tails"
of a pasha, indicate the position of the wearer, the red
being considered the highest of all. In addition to the
button the military insignia of a tuft of horse hair, dyed
scarlet, depended from the top of the hat of each, whilst
some of the more fortunate wore a peacock's feather
stuck jauntily under the button. I say more fortunate
because, like our K.C.B.'s, only a very few can ever hope
to attain to such a mark of the sovereign's favor. These
feathers are bestowed by the emperor, generally in person,
on such of his subjects as have achieved some renown,
either as a soldier or in the equally honorable province
of letters. We may well believe, then, that amongst such
a people as the Chinese, whose very breath almost is at
the emperor's pleasure, such a distinction is the chiefest
ambition of every man; for <i>all</i> may aspire to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>A day or so subsequent to the events I have described
before, the captain of a trading junk from Tientsin reported
that the "Vigilant" had grounded in the Pei-ho,
and had sustained considerable damage to her rudder
and stern-post, a report which was strictly true; for soon
the admiral returned, and at once ordered the "Vigilant"
to Hong Kong for repairs.</p>

<p>Shortly before sailing the admiral inspected the ship.
On this occasion "Sailor," our widowed cat, was decked
out in all the gay and gaudy trappings of a field officer
on parade, and, what is more to the point, he was seemingly
quite aware that he was looking smart. I suppose
"Sailor" can never have read the "Jackdaw of Rheims,"
but he certainly <i>looked</i> the words of that conceited bird
as he strutted proudly along before the admiral; and I
feel assured that, though the commander-in-chief may
not have thought much about the matter, there was no
doubt in pussy's mind as to <i>his</i> being one of the "greatest
folk here to-day."</p>

<p>By the third day out we had reached the Corean
archipelago, and found ourselves off the northern coast
of Quelpart, where we had recently met with such rough
handling. The course was slightly altered to enable us
to touch at a small island in the same group, named Port
Hamilton. This, until very recently, was, I believe, the
only place in the peninsula empire where foreigners&mdash;Europeans
and Americans&mdash;were allowed to hold any
intercourse with the natives. It was left to our admiral
to alter this edict, and to break through their prejudices.</p>

<p>October 23rd.&mdash;At four o'clock this morning we dashed
through the strait of Simoneski under steam and canvas,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>with the wind dead aft and fresh, in company with some
hundreds of junks, whose bellying snowy sails and neat
trim hulls had much the appearance of a yachting contest.</p>

<p>By sundown we had made the original anchorage.
Owing, I suppose, to the season being further advanced,
the scenery has lost that freshness we noticed during
our first trip through, but not its charm&mdash;I think it
could never do that. The little bay looked very lovely
to-night with the moon's flood of silver light streaming
down on its thousand isles.</p>

<p>"Fair luna" had scarcely left us to gladden another
world of night before the anchor was at the bows and the
ship holding on her onward course; and though the wind
was both strong and favourable, no advantage was taken
of it to sail, for we were navigating such intricate labyrinths,
cutting so sharply around islets, and dodging in
and out so many channels and passages, that the jib and
spanker were the only sails that could be used with any
degree of safety; but when at length we broke out into
the open again, we spread our wings to the gale and made
short work of the distance to Kob&eacute;.</p>

<p>Our arrival was most opportune, both for ourselves and
also for society on shore. To the regatta committee we
were specially welcome, for a regatta was to be held in the
afternoon, and the presence of our band was certainly a
pleasing and unlooked-for item in the programme of
proceedings. Our third cutter took the first prize in the
navy race, though it was an open question whether the
Russian boat did not deserve it. It was ruled that
"Rooski" had forfeited all claim to a place, in consequence
of fouling twice&mdash;so somebody said; though there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>were others who declared that ours fouled the Russians.
This led to angry words, and a considerable show of
splenetic feeling amongst the committee, which was at
length toned down by the appearance of a Russian officer,
who begged that, rightly or wrongly, the prize might be
awarded to the English boat.</p>

<p>Whilst at Kob&eacute; an event took place on board, of small
moment indeed to the big outside world, but one of
considerable interest amongst ourselves, namely, the birth
of a lamb. If we except the rats and cockroaches, and a
few such-like atomies, this is the first being which has
drawn its first breath on board. One of the sheep taken
in at Chefoo happened to be in an "interesting condition,"
and as nature was not to be thwarted of her purpose
by big guns and tarry sailors, the little fellow came along
in due course. We are anxious that he may live, for it is
wonderful what tricks and antics sailors can train a lamb
to, not the least being the avidity with which, after a few
lessons, he makes his number at the grog tub at the sound
of the bugle.</p>

<p>November 3rd.&mdash;Onward, ever onward; a flying visit
to Yokohama, and then back home again, or the nearest
approach to home that this part of the world affords for
Englishmen.</p>

<p>But how changed is Yokohama now! Dirty, wet, cold,
and dreary, and all the other adjectives by which discomfort
is usually interpreted. During our stay our negro
troupe came prominently before the public. At the
request of the managing committee of the Temperance
Hall the captain yielded, a somewhat reluctant assent, to
the attendance of the troupe. They performed before a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>highly pleased and encouraging audience, and had no
occasion to blush at the report of the entertainment in
the papers. At any rate many a disinterested resident in
the cause of temperance was induced to unbutton his
pockets to further that end.</p>

<p>An entertainment, on a vastly different scale, was given
to our officers, by the imperial family at Tokio. For a
whole day they were the guests of Prince Arisugawa in
his capacity of heir-apparent to the royal dignities. Perhaps
"heir-apparent" is not strictly the correct term to
apply to the royal "mid," the emperor having the power
to bestow the crown on whomsoever he lists at his demise.
The prince is but the adopted son of the emperor, who
has issue of his own; he may set aside, and it is generally
understood that he will do so, his own children in favour
of his adopted child; by no means an uncommon custom
amongst the nobility of Japan.</p>

<p>Recent arrivals from the southward having reported
stormy passage, more than the usual precautions were
taken to prepare the ship for whatever might chance to fall
athwart our hawse. A deck cargo of coals was taken in,
storm sails bent, extra gripes put on the boats, and
anchors lashed; but, as generally turns out in such cases,
neither of these preparations were more than ordinary
necessary, for save a roll or two in Formosa's tumbling
channel, the splitting of a stunsail boom, and the snapping
of a rope now and then, the passage was a fairly smooth
one. We put in at Matson, en route, when we found the
"Lapwing" awaiting our arrival with mails and the men
we left behind in Malta hospital on the outward voyage.
Theirs has been a chequered existence since that time;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>now one ship, now another, until up to this time they
can reckon up eight such shifts.</p>

<p>December 4th.&mdash;Whilst coaling at Amoy an accident
happened, which has resulted in the death of another of
our poor fellows, George Allen, an ordinary seaman.
Whilst he and a companion were on a visit to a Chinese
gunboat in the harbour, and both, it is to be feared,
under the influence of liquor, Allen slipped as he was
mounting the side, fell overboard, and was not seen
afterward. Strangely enough, the man who was with him
had not the slightest idea of the occurrence, and it was
not until the captain of the Chinaman came on board the
following morning and reported the circumstance, that
we became aware that we had lost a shipmate. Before
sailing we were joined by the "Egeria," and as it was the
admiral's intention to visit Swatow we called in at Hope
bay to allow him to turn over to the "Egeria" for that
purpose. We arrived in Hong Kong on December 15th.</p>

<p>And now, dear reader, I have accomplished the round
of our station, and have got through, I trust, to your
satisfaction, the most difficult part of this narrative, viz.:
the descriptive. Henceforward, to avoid tiring and useless
repetition I shall refer you to the appendix for ports
visited, only taking up for narrative purposes, such events
in our subsequent history as I shall deem of major
importance. If I do not adopt some such plan as this
my book will far exceed its intended limits.</p>

<p>December 25th.&mdash;If we may believe the old saw, there
are some things which have the misfortune to suffer by
comparison. Accepting this as fact, the Christmas of last
year must hide its diminished head before its present
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>anniversary. We were determined on making our lower
deck as home-like as possible, to deceive
ourselves&mdash;pleasant fiction!&mdash;into the belief that there were not 120
degrees of longitude between us and our friends. The
admiral behaved like a brick, by contributing largely to
the good cheer. The mess-deck just showed how tastefully
sailors can do things in the way of "get ups" when
left to their own devices and resources. As Christmas,
1880, was by far the jolliest Christmas day we have spent
during our sojourn in China, I will not anticipate by
describing the present, but will reserve for a subsequent
page the pleasure of telling you all about it.</p>

<p class="summary">IN WHICH WE ATTEMPT AN OVERLAND ROUTE, WITH THE
RESULT OF THE TRIAL.</p>

<p>Hail, all hail, to the glad new year! What though
there be no crisp seasonable snow, no exhilarating
frost, no cosy chimney nooks, or no ladies muffs
and comfortable ulsters? Let us joy at his birth all the
same, for does he not mark another year nearer the end?&mdash;of
the commission I mean.</p>

<p>And now to work. At the annual inspection of our heavy
guns it was found that three at least were so defective in
the bore that it was necessary to condemn them, and
replace them by new ones. This entailed a terrible
amount of labour on our men. Hatchways had to be
torn to pieces, and yards rigged with most ponderous
blocks, and purchases for the safe transhipment of these
iron playthings. Whatever may be urged against, there is
this to be said in favour of such heavy and unusual
evolutions, that observant men gain largely in practical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>experience and an extended acquaintance with the "might
be's" of their profession. Fortunately, in one sense, but
few commissions afford such unwelcome opportunities as
ours, for it has been one of accidental, rather than of
meditated experiment.</p>

<p>In the midst of dismal rainy weather the business of
refitting had to be pushed forward, previous to our going
in dock; then coaling and painting&mdash;in our ship separate
work&mdash;and provisioning, swallowed up the greater part of
the month of January.</p>

<p>February 11th.&mdash;To-day the "Tyne" arrived from England.
To the expatiated seaman the arrival of a troopship
has a greater interest than have ordinary arrivals; for
has she not scarce two months since, perhaps, looked on
the very scenes we so long to behold? She is thus a link
between us and home. Then there is also the additional
interest of seeing fresh faces, whilst to the more fortunate
who are about to leave us she is the absorbing topic. She
remained only eight days. On the occasion of her
departure we were allowed to cheer&mdash;a wonderful concession;
at the same time we were given clearly to understand
that we were to accept it in the light of a great privilege;
and that there should be no mistake on this point, the
commander conducted the arrangements with the order
"Three cheers for H.M.S. 'Tyne,' homeward bound;"
"And no extras," added somebody in parenthesis.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now came April 15th, not so rapidly as would
appear from the above sketch; but it came, and with it
the commencement of a second voyage to the northward.</p>

<p>In the interval between the sailing of the "Tyne" and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>our departure we were not idle. We had gone outside
twice&mdash;once at target practice and once on steam tactics.
The "Armide," French flag-ship, had left for Europe, and
her relief, the "Th&eacute;mis," had arrived on the station, losing
several sheets of copper off her starboard bow on the
passage up from Singapore.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe the different customs of foreign
sailors when sailing, homeward bound. The French, for
instance, rig up a dummy man and trice him up to the
main top, where he is made to oscillate with a pendulum
movement until he gains sufficient impetus to clear the
side, when he is let go overboard amidst the cheering of
the men. The Russians man yards, white caps in hand,
which, after waving in the air to make their cheering more
energetic, they fling into the sea.</p>

<p>But to return to April 15th.&mdash;We had but cleared Hong
Kong when we sighted the "Charybdis," with the long
pennant flying. Fortunate fellows! how long, I wonder,
before we shall be similarly decorated? I write this
almost three years afterwards, and still the question
remains unanswered.</p>

<p>On the way we put in to White Dogs, in expectation of
finding the "Vigilant" with our mail. The mails latterly
have been very erratic in their arrivals, due to a change
in the postal system at home. Henceforth there is to be no
penny mail&mdash;a fact which, seemingly, our friends have not
yet grasped; hence it is no uncommon thing to go weeks
without letters, and then suddenly to find oneself inundated
with&mdash;say six or eight <i>billets doux</i>.</p>

<p>The "Vigilant" was only a few hours behind us; and
after giving us our mail she left for Foo-chow, with the
admiral and captain on board.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>That night we rode out a very stiff gale. The seas
were so heavy that all ports had to be barred in, and even
then, such was the violence of the storm that water was
occasionally shipped through the upper battery ports.
From the manner in which the cable "surged" and
bumbed, it was deemed expedient to let go a second
anchor, and to get up steam; for in the event of the wind
chopping around&mdash;nothing more likely&mdash;we should be on
a dead lee shore, and our only alternative to slip and go
to sea. Still the gale increased, and still the one anchor
and cable held. How the wind did howl and screech
through our cordage! This lasted for over two days. On
the third day the "Moorhen" came down from Foo-chow
with our captain; and as there was still a big lump of a
sea on, she capered about in the lively manner peculiar
to gun vessels.</p>

<p>April 21st.&mdash;We rounded the Shun-tung promontory in
a thick fog, groped our way towards Chefoo in the same
hazy atmosphere, and picked up our anchorage in nearly
the same spot as last year, glad enough to get in anywhere
out of such dangerous weather.</p>

<p>The cutter's crew of the "Pegasus," a day or two after
our arrival, reminded us of a challenge they had previously
thrown out, to pull any boat of similar size in our
ship for forty-five dollars. Accordingly, one fine afternoon
when the sea was as smooth as a pond, and on the
occasion of a dance given by our officers, the contest
came off. Contrary to the expectations of most, our
boat beat almost without an effort. That same evening
the "Lily's," with more pluck than discretion, tossed
their oars under our bows. Well, like a great good-tempered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Newfoundland dog, we can stand a deal of
snapping at from insignificant puppies, but when at
length their attacks begin to get acrimonious, we rise, and
shake our shaggy coat; and in salt water language "<i>go</i>"
for the torments. Thus we "<i>went</i>" for the "Lily's,"
beat them, and pocketed thirty-six dollars more.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the admiral a court-martial was held
on a marine, of the "Mosquito," for insubordination.
I mention this because of the extreme sentence of the
court&mdash;twenty-five lashes with the "cat." The admiral,
though, came to the rescue, and with mercy seasoned
justice, for he refused to sign the warrant for the
punishment.</p>

<p>We left Chefoo for Japan, calling in at the Golo islands&mdash;a
group about 90 miles from Nagasaki&mdash;on the way.
'Twas a lovely spot, and recent rains had made nature
look all the fairer for her ablutions. The gentle breeze
wafted off such a delightful fragrance of pine, fir, hay,
and flowers, so welcome after China's reeking smells.
Slowly, and with caution, we wended our way up an
intricate channel, meandering amongst the hills in a most
striking and artistic manner, until further progress was
barred, by the shores of a tiny bay, with a town at its
head. We found ourselves so perfectly land-locked that
everybody was wondering how we got in. Around us
high volcanic hills, and under us,&mdash;not a volcano&mdash;but,
between twenty and thirty fathoms of water. We could
not anchor here, that was evident, so we set the spanker,
slued about, and made tracks as rapidly as we could
before the darkness should set in. Next morning we
were at Nagasaki.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>Early on the morning of the 29th of May we sailed
for the eastward, by way of the Inland Seas. We turned
slightly out of our course to call at Yobuko, a real bit of
Japan, lovely and enchanting. We were objects of
absorbing interest to the simple islanders. They wore
very primitive and airy garments, some even none at all.
They are not much like, in fact very unlike, a community
of Japanese; for cleanliness amongst them is an "unknown
quantity;" and their dwellings remind me very forcibly
of the squalid dens in Chinese native towns. The people,
though, were hospitable and kind to a degree, and highly
glad to see us, offering us of their little sak&eacute; and tea&mdash;nor
would they take money, or accept any payment,
though we pressed it upon them. At first they were shy,
following us about in curious, respectful, distant crowds;
but seeing we treated their chubby little children kindly
they soon made friends with us.</p>

<p>We reached Kob&eacute; in due course where nothing of
moment took place, if we except a gale of wind which
compelled our liberty-men&mdash;<i>much against their will</i>, of
course&mdash;to remain on shore all night. "Well '<i>'tis</i> an ill
wind that blows <i>nobody</i> good,' is it not?"</p>

<p>July 2nd.&mdash;We are at Yokohama, and are a-taut; for
to-day some members of the Japanese imperial family
are to visit us. At noon they arrived amidst salvoes of
artillery from the shore and from the Japanese men-of-war.
The party consisted of prince Arisugawa's father and
sister, her maids of honor, and two admirals. The
princess was of course the "lion"&mdash;excuse the
gender&mdash;of the party. But how lost, how utterly bewildered, she
looked in reaching our quarter-deck! like little Alice in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>wonderland. I hear it is the first time she has ever been
afloat. Her style of dress is different to anything we
have yet seen in this country. A red silk skirt clothed
her lower limbs, whilst a transparent gauzy purple tunic,
figured with the imperial emblem, fell from her shoulders
to the ground. But her hair was what drew most of our
attention, for it was the most remarkable piece of head
architecture possible. How shall I describe it? Imagine
a frying-pan inverted, its inner rim resting on the crown
of the head, and the handle depending down the back,
and you will have a correct, though a homely idea, of the
fashion of her hair. Each individual hair seemed as if
picked out from it fellows, stiffened by some process until
it appeared like a wire bent into shape; gathered in and
tied a little below the nape of the neck, and from thence
downward traced into a queue. Hers was the ideal type
of Japanese feature, so rarely seen amongst the common
people, and considered so unlovely by Europeans. A
long face, narrow straight nose, almond eyes, very
obliquely set in the head, and a mouth so tiny, so thin the
upper lip, that it looks more like a scarlet button than any
thing designed for kissing.</p>

<p>She was childishly pleased at everything she saw whilst
accompanying the admiral around the decks, twitching at
his arm incessantly that she might indulge her curiosity
as to hatchways, stoke-hole gratings, and so on; clapping
her hands continually in the exuberance of her joy.</p>

<p>The "Modeste" accompanied us in our trip to the
north on this occasion.</p>

<p>A few days out we called in at Kamaishi, in the neighbourhood
of which are the imperial copper mines and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>smelting works. The people here lack the rosiness and
freshness of face of the Japanese, and have a dowdy,
sickly look, due, I suppose, to the unhealthy exhalations
from the copper.</p>

<p>Instead of calling in at Hakodadi we continued on
along the eastern coast of Yezo until we reached Endermo
harbour, sentinelled at its entrance by a grim vomiting
volcano which, in addition to its charred and fire-scored
crater, has innumerable other little outlets in its sides,
giving out jets of steam and sulphurous smoke until the
very air is loaded with the oppressive vapour.</p>

<p>At the anchorage we saw the "Pegasus."</p>

<p>Here we are then! in the country of Miss Bird's A&iuml;nos,
a people whom she describes as the most gentle and
docile in the world. We had ample opportunity of
making their acquaintance, for during our stay the decks
were daily thronged with them. In these men the
advocates of Darwinism might well behold the missing link.
From head to heel they are covered with thick shaggy
unkempt masses of hair; that on their heads and faces
hanging down in wild elfish locks. They wear but scant
raiment, a sort of over-all, which does not pretend to the
use of even the most primitive covering. It is of the
men I speak. Strangely enough, though, they all have
their ears pierced, metal ornaments are not worn by any,
but, instead, they have a thin strip of scarlet cloth, just
simply placed through the hole. The women are strange
looking creatures. Their garments are modest enough,
far more so even than those of their southern sisters with
whom, by the way, they have nothing in common, save
their sex. Can it be that this is the primitive Japanese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>race&mdash;that the more enlightened people of Niphon trace
their origin to such a degraded source? I should be
inclined to say no, if I did not remember that history
furnishes us with so many parallel cases of similar
degraded origin&mdash;our own for example.</p>

<p>Well built, but oh! so ugly these women; and, as if
nature had not done enough for them in this particular,
they render their faces still more repulsive looking by
tattooing the lips on the outside to the depth of an inch
all around, elongating the mark at the corners. This, of
course, does not tend to lessen the apparent size of an
aperture, already suggestive of a main hatchway. This
unhandsome, open, flat countenance, is also further
decorated with bands of blue on the forehead. The
females wear large rings of iron&mdash;some few of
silver&mdash;in their ears.</p>

<p>Now, though of course I don't pretend to the faithfulness
of portraiture, nor to the accuracy of observation of
the travelled lady I have before quoted, yet I must add
that my estimate of this people, in my own small way, is
antagonistic to hers. To me they are only a very little
removed from savages. Their women seem to be in
abject slavery to the men, and are treated by them in the
most shameful manner. An instance, which came under
my own observation, will perhaps shew this. Whilst on
shore fishing, I had wandered away from the main party
to where I saw a native engaged at work on an upturned
canoe. Up the beach was his hut&mdash;I have seen many a
stye a king to it&mdash;and in the doorway his&mdash;wife must I
call her? Curious I suppose like all her sex she came
down the strand to get a look at the white-skinned, light-haired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>stranger, and was rewarded for temerity in a most
summary manner. The man, at first, seemed to expostulate
with her, and so far as I could judge, ordered her back to
her domicile; but as the lady did not seem prompt to
obey the mandate, he further emphasised his meaning
and accelerated her movements by flinging a billet of
wood at her with all the irresponsible and unrestrained
force of a savage nature. In the face of this can I agree
with Miss Bird? My first feeling was one of indignation
and an angry twitching of my ten digits to form themselves
into bunches of fives, but on second thoughts,
seeing that the poor woman took the chastisement as a
matter of course, and that she was seemingly used to such
like gentle reminders, my indignation cooled down to
matter of fact surprise.</p>

<p>This place is the exile home of one of the banished
da&iuml;mios I spoke of in a former chapter.</p>

<p>From Endermo we retraced ours steps to Hakodadi,
where, during a short stay, we had some amusement in the
shape of messes pulling for bags of "spuds" (the potatoe
of the non-sailor world) and other comestibles.</p>

<p>July 30th.&mdash;The date of the most important event of
the commission. Referring to my "journal" I find
recorded below this date that word of terrible import,
"stranded." Yea, truly are we. And this is how it all
came about. We had sailed from Hakodadi with a fair
wind, through the strait of Sangar and out into the sea of
Japan, shaped our course for Aniwa bay, in Sagalien, with&mdash;except
that the atmosphere was rather hazy&mdash;every
prospect of a fair and quick passage.</p>

<p>Off the south western corner of Yezo, and about ninety
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>miles from Hakodadi, lies the small island of O'Kosiri, in
the track of vessels going north. By morning we had
reached its neighbourhood&mdash;it could be seen in fact&mdash;when
suddenly a thick fog enveloped it, us, and the surrounding
sea. We were to have gone outside the island,
though the inner passage is navigable, still, to avoid any
possibility of an accident, it was deemed best to go to seaward
of it. At 4 a.m., whilst steaming at six knots, the
look out man reported land dead ahead. The officer of
the watch, seemingly pretty confident as to his whereabouts,
altered course a point or so, and kept on at the
same speed. An hour passed, the fog had settled thicker
than ever. At ten minutes past two bells in the morning,
without any warning&mdash;the lead even shewing deep
soundings&mdash;a crashing, grating sound was heard, accompanied
by a distinct trembling vibration, proceeding,
apparently, from under the ship's bottom. Even then, no
one dreamed we were ashore; such a sound, such a sensation,
might have been produced by running over a junk.
At this moment the leadsman got a throw of the lead,
and "<i>a quarter less four</i>," indicated only too plainly the
origin of the sounds.</p>

<p>With his usual promptness&mdash;as if running ashore was
a matter of ordinary evolution&mdash;our captain at once gave
orders for engines to be reversed, for boats to be hoisted
out, and anchors placed away, where they would be of
most use; at the same time directions were given to have
the steam launch coaled and provisioned to go back to
Hakodadi for assistance. On soundings being taken along
the starboard side plenty of water was obtained; it was
only on her port bottom that the ship had grounded. Efforts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>were made to roll her off, all hands rushing from one side
of the deck to the other, but without result. Through
the crystal clear water, and in the deep shadow of the
ship, the nature of the bottom could be clearly seen&mdash;coral
rocks and yellow sand. Fortunately the sea was
a flat calm, or it must have fared ill indeed with us.</p>

<p>At ordinary times the sailor prefers plenty of sea room,
and the further he is from land the safer he feels; but
when one's ship has suddenly converted "<i>mare</i>" into
"<i>terram</i>" with, may be, a hole in her to boot, then
indeed the proximity to some friendly shore is his first
consideration.</p>

<p>The lifting fog revealed to us our whereabouts; within
a hundred yards of us the surf washed edges of a reef,
and before us the low shores and high hills of O'Kosiri.</p>

<p>The unusual sight of a large ship so near their island
soon brought the natives off in their queer canoes. By
means of our interpreter we learn that the people had
never seen a man-of-war before; that there was no rise
and fall of tide there; and much more about the ways
and means available for opening up communications with
Hakodadi.</p>

<p>Meanwhile shot and shell were got out and sent on
shore, and coals pitched overboard, because no lighters
were obtainable at this stage in the proceedings. The
divers having gone down reported the ship aground in
three distinct places, aft, amidships under the batteries,
and forward. Thus ended the first day. With the morrow
a swell set in from seaward, which caused us to bump
heavily, though it did not alter our position. On this day
the expected assistance arrived from Hakodadi. Close
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>on each other's heels the following ships bore down upon
us:&mdash;the "Modeste," with lighters in tow, the
"Kerguelen," "Champlain," and "Th&eacute;mis," Frenchmen,
the latter the admiral's ship; and the Russian corvette
"Naezdnik," with the admiral's flag at the mizen.</p>

<p>These five ships at once anchored in the best positions
consistent with their own safety to help us; the
"Kerguelen" a little on our starboard quarter, and the
"Champlain" right astern with our steel hawsers on board
and two anchors down.</p>

<p>With the second night came a chapter of accidents.</p>

<p>At sunset a rolling sea again set in, heavier than that
of the morning. The swell and the weight of our hawsers
acting on the necessarily short cables of the "Champlain"
caused that vessel to drag and take the ground on our
port quarter. In her attempts to extricate herself, our
steel hawser got foul of her propeller and wound itself
around it in such a confused mass, that the vessel's
machinery became practically useless. Thus, side by side,
the two companions in distress kept the watches of that
night. But this was not all; the "Modeste" coming to
the rescue of the "Champlain," ran into the "Kerguelen,"
but fortunately without any serious result.</p>

<p>Sunday, August 1st.&mdash;At daylight the "Modeste" succeeded
in towing the "Champlain" out of her perilous
position. As she did so a large piece of the Frenchman's
false keel floated to the surface, whilst she was found to
be making two and a half tons of water per hour. A
turn of her propeller the other way caused the now useless
hawser to fall off. When recovered by the divers, this
mass of steel wire was a gordian knot of utter confusion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>The swell of last night, though it did our ship and the
"Champlain" some harm, rendered us at least one
service, by causing a higher influx of water than usual,
which resulted in lifting us off our pinnacled and dangerous
resting place into deep soundings again. And now it
was discovered that we too were taking in water in one of
our compartments which, however, thanks to our double
bottom system, we were enabled to confine to the one
space.</p>

<p>As we passed slowly by the anchored ships, cheer after
cheer rent the still air, whilst the bands played our national
anthem. An analysis of the sounds of this multitudinous
chorus of men's voices, was a very interesting, though not
a difficult matter. The sweet cadence of the Frenchmen's
low cheer was clearly a distinct sound from the Russian's
ursine growl; whilst the Englishmen's "hip, hip, hurrah!"
if not so musical as the first, nor as bearish as the second,
was a more honest sound than either.</p>

<p>On the following evening, after having bundled all our
stores on board, we put back to Hakodadi for coal and to
allow the admiral to turn over to the "Modeste."</p>

<p>August 6th.&mdash;Off for Hong Kong by the Japan sea
passage, touching at Nagasaki for coal, and hence on to
Amoy against a south-west monsoon, and into the scorching
heat of the southern summer. A few hours at Amoy
sufficed us to take in enough coal for the short distance
to Hong Kong, where we had the satisfaction of finding
ourselves, without mishap, on August 18th. Almost
immediately the hands were sent on board the "Victor
Emmanuel," whilst the ship was undergoing repairs at
Aberdeen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>Whilst resting on the chocks in the dock the extent of
the damage sustained by us was plainly visible; and,
when we come to consider, that fourteen plates had to be
removed and replaced by new ones, and this too in the
immediate neighbourhood of the keel, the wonder is that
Chinamen accomplished the cumbrous work satisfactorily.</p>

<p>September 20th.&mdash;Exactly one month ago to-day the
ship was docked&mdash;to-day she came out; what do you
think of that for expedition? On floating it was found
that a slight damage to the Kingston valve had been overlooked,
and as the ship was still making water, it was
thought a second docking would be necessary. Fortunately
our very effective diving staff were able to repair it
without the bother and additional expense of being
shored up again.</p>

<p>September 22nd.&mdash;A fed-letter day. Why? Oh, only
because&mdash;"tell it not in Gath"&mdash;the captain "<i>spliced the
main brace</i>!" Yea, yea, verily! The fact was, his ship
had been got ready for sea in <i>two days</i>; hence the <i>splicing</i>.</p>

<p>September 23rd.&mdash;We were to have gone to sea to-day,
but "<i>l'homme propos&eacute;</i>." Rumours of an approaching
atmospheric disturbance had been telegraphed from
Manilla, within the previous forty-eight hours. Other
usual and confirmatory indications were also observed;
the presence of an unusual number of jelly-fish in the harbour
till the sea stank with them; the lurid appearance of
the sunset sky, as if the heavens were bathed in blood;
the arrival of hundreds of junks from seaward seeking
shelter: all these signs summed up were considered satisfactory
reasons for preparing for a typhoon&mdash;than which,
I suppose, no wind is more violent and destructive. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>is said that persons who have never witnessed the sublime
and terrible spectacle can scarcely realize, even from the
most graphic descriptions of eye witnesses, what a typhoon
really means. A Chinaman informed me that the last
typhoon destroyed not less than 18,000 persons in this
neighbourhood alone&mdash;not a large number when we
bear in mind the enormous floating populations in
Chinese towns. All the day the air was ominous of a
coming something. At noon I asked a Chinaman when
it might be expected. His answer shewed me how even
this mighty destroyer is guided by a far mightier hand&mdash;"Suppose
he no' com now, he com by'm by, nine clock."
Well, "he" did not come now; but at 9 p.m.&mdash;and
almost simultaneous with the firing of the gun&mdash;it came
on to blow; but, mercifully, not a typhoon, only the
spent violence of one. Even this necessitated the letting
go a second anchor and the steaming head on to it, for
upwards of five hours.</p>

<p>With the morning the gale had considerably abated,
and as the barometer was on the rise, and the captain
impatient to clear out, we put to sea. But clearly the
weather was in a very unsettled state, and outside Amoy
the glass again went down with a rising head sea. That
we might put into Amoy for shelter, all the furnaces were
called into requisition; so we lashed into and almost
buried ourselves in seas rearing themselves up a-head of
us like walls of solid glass. We brought up in the outer
harbour just as the shades of night and the roar of the
coming storm gathered around us. That night the wind
and sea played fast and furious with our ship; again we
had escaped a typhoon&mdash;it was subsequently ascertained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>that one did actually visit the adjacent coasts and sea; but,
as this wind travels in a circle of many miles diameter,
with its greatest force distributed near its circumference,
its centre only passed over Amoy. On steaming seaward
the next morning desolation, destruction, and wreck were
everywhere manifest.</p>

<p>In due course we reached Nagasaki. In the bay
was the Russian iron-clad, "Minin," a ship&mdash;if all we
hear about her be true&mdash;capable of blowing the "Iron
Duke" sky-high. She is, however, inferior to us in many
desirable qualities, particularly in the essential one of
being able to keep the sea, and fight her guns in all
weathers. The "Comus," one of our handsome steel
corvettes, was also here.</p>

<p>The hard steaming from Nagasaki, against exceptionally
heavy winds, had pretty well cleared us out of coal, and,
as there was not enough in store here to supply us with,
we were ordered off to Kob&eacute; to fill up.</p>

<p>On our return, and just as we had cleared the strait of
Simonoseki, we fell in with what sailors term nasty
weather. The ship behaved so saucily that a seaman,
Alexander Mann, whilst engaged lashing the anchor was
washed completely overboard and borne away astern.
Daniel Mutch, the captain of his top&mdash;a petty-officer who
has already been instrumental in saving life at sea&mdash;observing
the accident, at once rushed aft to the stern,
plunged boldly into the turbulent waves and succeeded in
rescuing his topmate. It is satisfactory to be able to
state that the captain recognised Mutch's bravery by
applying for the Humane Society's Medal, which honorable
decoration was received shortly afterwards.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>Next day an event of a similar nature, but unfortunately
with a sadder termination, took place. In setting the
starboard stunsail, John Irish, A.B., lost his hold of the
scarping on the starboard fore-and-aft bridge, through the
wood treacherously giving away with his weight, and,
being unable to swim, the poor fellow soon sank exhausted,
just as Joseph Summers had arrived on the spot.
Irish had but lately come into a legacy from some of his
friends at home.</p>

<p>Early in December we left Nagasaki for Hong Kong,
touching at the Rugged Isles, on the opposite Chinese
coast, on the passage. We spent about as uncomfortable
a week in this delicious retreat as can be well conceived;
our appetites sharpened to a keen edge by a north China
winter&mdash;a week never to be forgotten. Opportunely the
admiral came in at the expiration of time and terminated
our miseries by ordering us to proceed.</p>

<p>December 20th.&mdash;To-day, and on the two subsequent
days, the "one gun salute" at eight bells from the
"Victor Emanuel" announced that somebody's fate was
to be sealed. Three of our officers&mdash;the captain, staff-commander,
and Lieutenant Clarke&mdash;are to be tried on a
charge, preferred by the admiral, of negligently stranding
Her Majesty's Ship "Iron Duke." Much interest
naturally centred around this trial; the reporters from
the local papers exerting themselves to the utmost for
information on such an engrossing topic. On the third
day the sentence of the court was announced:&mdash;the
captain and Mr. Clarke to be reprimanded, and the staff-commander
to be severely so.</p>

<p>December 25th.&mdash;To fulfil a promise of twelve months'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>standing, from the 20th to the 25th discipline was relaxed
that we might prepare for our one festival; and as the
admiral had again rendered us pecuniary help, and as this
would be his last Christmas with us we were determined
on making it a success. Meanwhile, whilst the decorations
are pushing ahead, I must pause to notice the naval
regatta of the 23rd, and especially the race which came
about between our cutter and a similar boat of the "Lily,"
which it will be remembered we beat at Chefoo recently;
but so confident were the "Lily's" that our victory on
that occasion was the result of a "fluke," that they challenged
us again to pull for sixty dollars. The race was
conclusive to the "Lily's," and they handed over the
"Mexicans" with the best grace a small ship's company
can be supposed to exhibit&mdash;on the eve of Christmas, too.</p>

<p>An interesting feature in the regatta, and one which
caused no end of fun, was the get-up of the copper punts.
These naval abortions are, for the nonce, handed over to
the funny fellows on board, who proceed to elect a
"captain," and appoint themselves to the various offices
connected with the proper management of their craft.
With great rapidity and no little skill these punts are
metamorphosed into brigs, full-rigged ships, paddle-wheeled
steamers, and ram-bowed ironclads. The "captain's"
get-up is the most gorgeous and elaborate thing
possible&mdash;a profusion of gold lace, a monster cocked hat
suitable for the top of the great pyramid, and a tremendous
speaking trumpet whose bore would do very well for
a tunnel. His crew generally attire themselves in the
fantastic dress of niggers. Just as the proceedings for
the day were about to begin, a pigmy paddler was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>observed bearing down on the flag-ship&mdash;her puffing
funnel and foaming bows betraying no mean steam
power. On closing she was made out to be one of the
punt fleet come to pay a visit to the admiral. As she lay
to she ran the St. George's Cross up to the main, and
saluted it with seventeen guns (wooden ones), out of
compliment to Admiral Coote, who shortly receives his
promotion. She next asked permission (by signal) to part
company, a request the admiral answered by hoisting the
affirmative. It was indeed real fun.</p>

<p>By the 24th our lower deck looked a veritable fairy
bower, but essentially English&mdash;a character which the
arrival of the "Th&egrave;mis," on Christmas eve, modified
somewhat. With characteristic good feeling and with,
perhaps, a spice of national vanity, we determined on
asking the Frenchmen to dine with us on the morrow&mdash;first,
because having just come in from sea they would be
unable to prepare for themselves; and, secondly, that we
might shew them how Englishmen observe Christmas day.
Our invitation asked that three hundred men might be
allowed to come, but half that number only could be
spared.</p>

<p>It now became necessary to make our surroundings as
international as possible, and as, happily, the French flag
does not demand any very great skill in its formation, we
soon had the tri-color stuck up everywhere; whilst in the
most conspicuous positions French mottoes shewed out
from the greenery. The wording of these latter was a
tremendous effort, so limited was our knowledge of our
nearest neighbour's tongue. Just to quote a few:&mdash;surrounding
every pudding a scroll with "Bien venue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>'Th&egrave;mis'" painted on it; in the mess shelves, "Vive la
France;" whilst, occupying a commanding place, the following
long yarn&mdash;"Servons nous votre reine mais honneur
&agrave; la republique fran&ccedil;ais," shone out in great gilt
letters. Then, too, there were plenty of legends in
English; and noticing these, one would be surprised at
the wit, no less than at the talent, exhibited in their
execution. For example, here is a sailor depicted with a
most lugubrious and "I-wish-I-might-get-it" expression
on his rather florid face, looking into an empty grog-tub;
and that there may be no ambiguity about the matter, the
word <i>empty</i> is printed on the tub, and attached to his
mouth a balloon-shaped sack containing the following
visible speech&mdash;"Three years on the 'Alert' but no
'Discovery.'" A second tar is represented holding a
stranded rope up to his captain, whilst he na&icirc;vely remarks,
"It wants splicing, sir." There were also several mottoes
specially designed as compliments to the admiral.</p>

<p>At noon on Christmas day we awaited on the quarter
deck the arrival of our guests, who, as soon as they came
inboard were ushered below and placed in the posts of
honor at the tables. After the admiral, captain, and
officers had made the round of the decks, preceded by
the band playing the immortal strains of "The roast beef
of Old England," the shrill whistles piped "fall-to."</p>

<p>And now might have been witnessed a laughable scene,
men rushing and hurrying about here, there, and everywhere,
exclaiming "Have you seen our Frenchmen?" or
"I've lost a Frenchman," and so on. But at length the
lost were found, and were, ere long, contemplating the
formidable heap of indigestible stuff set before them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>Such mountains of pudding, goose, ham, mutton, beef,
and pickles&mdash;all packed on one plate&mdash;I suppose it rarely
falls to the lot of the more polished Frenchman to behold.
Well might they look aghast at the miracle required of
them. It is the proverbial hospitality of the Englishman,
enacted over again, which always imagines its guest
starving. Considering that not one word of the other's
language was understood on either side, a very kindly
feeling sprang up between us during the afternoon, and
the time of departure arrived all too soon. After the tea,
which was to all intents and purposes a repetition of the
mid-day meal, the Frenchmen's boats came alongside, the
crews invited inboard and loaded with the d&egrave;bris of the
feast. When at length they left us, the Frenchmen all
stood up in their boats, whilst we lined our bridges and
spar deck, and a succession of deafening cheers brought
the happy day to a close&mdash;cheers which most of the ships
in port took up as the boats passed their bows. So ended
Christmas, 1880.</p>

<p>Sunday, January 2nd.&mdash;For some time past we have
been exercised to know how we could best signify
to the admiral our appreciation of his many kindnesses
to us during the time we have served under him.
His approaching promotion gave us the desired opportunity,
and it was decided that the most fitting present
would be a silk flag of the largest size, to be hoisted at
the main on that auspicious occasion. With this end in
view we had purchased some 130 yards of silk at Nagasaki,
which had been made up on board so quietly that few
even of those most interested in it knew of its progress.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>To day he was to hoist his flag as full admiral for the
first time; and on this morning a deputation of the ship's
company awaited on him in his cabin to make the presentation.
The captain, in a few suitable words, having
introduced the representatives, and the admiral having
responded to their presentation address in simple, unaffected,
heartfelt language, the flag was soon fluttering in
lazy folds aloft, to be saluted at "eight bells" by the shore
battery and foreign men-of-war in harbour. A most
innocent thing that flag, and scarcely could we conceive
that it was destined to become the occasion of newspaper
paragraphs, parliamentary questionings, admiralty minutes,
and that sort of thing, but it was so to be. By one of the
regulations of the service no officer may receive presents
or testimonials from his men&mdash;hence the correspondence.
It is, however, satisfactory to know that in the present
instance the admiralty allowed the admiral to retain our
flag.</p>

<p>January 7th.&mdash;To-day's mail proved a complete hoax.
By it we were speedily to be relieved&mdash;so said all our
private letters, so corroborated the officers, and even the
admiral seemed to give a certain amount of credence to
the rumour. But need I say it was a chimera. The
papers are to blame for all this; for they stated that
Admiral Willes had inspected the "Swiftsure" and had
found her in every way fit for his flag-ship. This was all
true; but what wasn't, was&mdash;that she is to come out to
relieve us.</p>

<p>February 16th.&mdash;A month since&mdash;and if anyone had
asked us where we should be bound when next we slipped
from the buoy, we should have answered with a joyful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>"<i>homeward</i>!" To-day we know better. We are speeding
Singapore-ward, it is true, but not to meet our relief.
The voyage into those torrid seas was not momentous,
and a week afterwards we lay alongside the coaling jetty
before spoken of.</p>

<p>And now we became aware that quite an unexpected
and perhaps in some respects&mdash;judging from after experience&mdash;not
altogether a welcome change was about to
be made in our executive. The admiral, of course, leaves
under any circumstances; but, further, the captain, commander,
and staff-commander were to be superseded, their
reliefs being already on the passage out. In addition, the
chaplain and Mr. Clarke were to leave, though at their
own request.</p>

<p>By the mail of the 26th the first instalment of our fresh
officers arrived. These were the admiral, G. O. Willes, of
Devonport dockyard celebrity and traditionally known to
us; the commander, nephew to the admiral; and the flag
lieutenant.</p>

<p>February 28th.&mdash;So quietly, that the majority of us
scarce knew of it, the admiral left to-day for England, and
with him the good wishes of everybody on the lower deck.
With the hauling down of the flag at the main, and its
re-hoisting at the fore, a new departure in the conduct of
the fleet on the China station was inaugurated. Henceforth
a season of activity, seasoned with salt junk, is to be
the order of the day.</p>

<p>After a short cruise with the squadron in Singapore
waters, during which period the "Tyne" arrived with our
new captain, and having bid good-bye to Captain Cleveland,
we stood away for Hong Kong, encountering such heavy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>weather on the passage that we were compelled to put
into Saigon for coal.</p>

<p>The anchorage to seaward of Saigon&mdash;which town is
the French capital of Gambodin, part of the kingdom of
Anam, and situated some miles up the river Dong-nai&mdash;is
Cape St. James, where we brought up until the tide should
suit for the river passage. In the first watch we commenced
to go up the river by the light of a brilliant moon,
which, however, did not allow us to judge of the beauties
of what is really a beautiful river. By the following morning
we had arrived off the town; and what a surprise it
was to see a popular European town in such a situation,
well laid out, clean, and&mdash;well, thoroughly French. The
river here is so narrow, and yet of so even a depth, that,
in turning, our dolphin striker was buried in the foliage
on the one bank and our stern almost touching the opposite
one. The town is seemingly built on a well-drained
swamp or marsh, and consequently lies very low, in fact,
from our topgallant forecastle we could command a pretty
general view of the whole of it. Ashore the place is just
as pretty as it looks from the ship. It is almost a miniature
of Paris. A great cathedral, Notre Dame&mdash;an exact
model of that on the island in the Seine; a palace for the
governor, which might well accommodate an emperor;
streets with Parisian names; boulevards and champs, all
bearing the well-known nomenclature of the gay capital;
caf&eacute;s, hotels, all remind one of the Paris of Dumas'
charming novels. It is the boulevards, streets, and promenades,
planted with trees, which make Saigon so beautiful,
so cool, and so refreshing towards the evening even
in a temperature where to live is a punishment. It is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>until sunset that we see anything of the French population,&mdash;then,
indeed, the caf&eacute;s and restaurants are in full
swing, and gay with music and laughter. These places of
refreshment are generally <i>al fresco</i>; and as each tiny pure
white marble table is presided over by pretty wholesome-looking
French girls and matrons, we must have less
impressionable hearts than sailors are known to possess if
we can pass so much mischief by unnoticed, so courteous
as these demoiselles are too.</p>

<p>The native population is Anamese, a race something
like the Chinese in feature, but differing from them slightly
in dress. They do not shave the head, but gather all
their hair into a knot at the top, which&mdash;in the case of
the females&mdash;they decorate with rolls of brilliantly
colored silks, generally scarlet or emerald green. The
dress of the ladies is far more graceful than that of their
"celestial" sisters, for though they wear the indispensable
trousers, yet that masculine garment is hid by a long sack-like
robe, something after the style of a priest's toga, of&mdash;in
nearly every case&mdash;emerald-green silk, a color which
seems to harmonise well with their complexion. The
men wear a similar garment of black silk.</p>

<p>Their walk is peculiar. They go barefoot, and strut,
rather than walk, without bending the knee, with chest
and stomach pompously projected. From this gait results
a certain balancing of the body and a movement to the
hips, which gives to the women a bold, and to the men
a pretentious air. Most of the women hide their faces
when a stranger heaves in sight; but it must not be
supposed from this that they are either modest or retiring,
on the contrary, for young girls and women yield their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>persons indiscriminately to men until they are married:
before that they are at liberty to do as they please, and
do not, in consequence, lose the respect of their fellows.
In fact, I am given to understand, most strangers find the
advances of the fair sex rather embarrassing.</p>

<p>At the landing place, and thronging the fine bronze
statute of Admiral Genouilly, the hero of Saigon, an
immense crowd had gathered to witness the embarkation
of the governor, on a visit to our admiral. His barge is
a splendidly got up affair. A large boat of native build,
painted and gilded till one could scarcely look on it, and
rowed by fourteen French seamen standing, clothed in
spotless white, with broad crimson sashes around their
waists. This equipage had such a holiday look about it,
that one of our fellows irreverently asked if "Sanger's
circus was coming!"</p>

<p>Only a day at Saigon, and off again. Instead of shaping
course direct for Hong Kong we hugged the coast of
Cochin China, thinking thus to cheat the monsoon. In
this we were mistaken, for the wind and sea proved so
strong that lower yards and topmasts had to be struck.
Thus it was not until the 25th, and after hard steaming,
that we reached Hong Kong.</p>

<p>April 16th.&mdash;To-day, William Edwards, second captain
of the main top, died in hospital of a complication of
debilitating complaints.</p>

<p>April 21st&mdash;Started on our yearly trip. Between Hong
Kong and Amoy we encountered a series of baffling fogs,
compelling us to anchor for days at a stretch. One clear
day the "Lapwing" passed, bound for Hong Kong. She
had recently been in collision with a Chinese merchant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>steamer, and inflicted such telling damage on the latter
that now her bones lie rotting at the bottom of the
Formosa channel.</p>

<p>At Amoy we found the first division of the cruising
squadron at anchor, under the command of Captain East,
of the "Comus." From Hong Kong here they had
been under the convoy of the admiral, who had, to use
an expression of one of the interested, given them a
thorough "shaking up," especially in the night watches.</p>

<p>Before sailing the "kit" of our late deceased shipmate
was disposed of at a public auction, and realised the sum
of &pound;25. This, together with a general subscription,
allowed us to send the comfortable sum of &pound;100 to his
widow. It is at these sales that one sees the sailor come
out in&mdash;what shall I say, a new character? Well, in a
way, yes; for he certainly exhibits a carefulness of thought
and an enlargement of the organ of feeling, for which the
world would scarce give him credit perhaps. I have often
thought it the most beautiful trait in an otherwise rough
and crude nature. Let it but be known that a poor
woman is left helpless to struggle through a hard and
selfish world, may-be children to add to her difficulties,
then you shall see that the sailor's heart is in the right
place; then all private animosity against the deceased
is swallowed up in the "charity which is kind."
The ancient Romans were not more eager to obtain a
memento of dead C&aelig;sar than they for some article of the
deceased's clothing; not so much for the sake of the
thing itself, but simply that, by the purchase of it, they
may exercise their generosity, by giving for it, perhaps,
four times its value.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>We have orders to cruise to Chefoo <i>under sail</i>. Fancy
an iron-clad making a passage under canvas! With the
"Iron Duke's" usual luck we encountered either boisterous
head winds or flat calms all the way, compelling us
to reef our canvas or to endure the tantalizing and
provoking agony of witnessing our sails hang in
picturesque, but useless, festoons up and down the masts.</p>

<p>For ten days we scarce saw the sun; for ten days the
sextants lay idle. When at length the sun did condescend
to slash the sky with his hopeful beams, we found we had
made the satisfactory average of <i>ten miles</i> a day. Our
potatoes, too,&mdash;that self-provided esculent upon which
sailors depend so much, and without which the admiralty
allowance assumes such skeleton proportions&mdash;now began
to fail us. As it was useless to attempt to reach Chefoo
under sail alone, steam was got up, and we managed to
make the harbour on June 6th.</p>

<p>Here again we picked up the squadron and the admiral,
the former of whom had been lying idle for fourteen days,
eating of the fat of the land, whilst we, like certain
ruminants, have been consuming our own fat, for want of
more natural food.</p>

<p>On the 11th, the squadron departed for evolutions in
the gulf of Pe-chili, outside, the admiral accompanying
to put them through a little practice.</p>

<p>Whilst at Chefoo, this time, we became acquainted with
the ladies and gentlemen of the China Inland Mission,
of whom Mr. Judd is the pastor. These toilers in God's
vineyard, for the better carrying out of their work, adopt
the Chinese national dress. The ladies are young, seemingly,
for such work, but possess unbounded enthusiasm.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>Their visits to the ships were frequent, but not the less
welcome in consequence; and long before we left we had
got to look upon them as very dear friends. On one
occasion they provided a temperance entertainment for as
many as could come in the Seamen's Hall, on shore&mdash;a
real floral f&ecirc;te, where the fair English faces of the ladies
seemed to vie with the lovely blossoms around. There
were many in that audience who went there under the
impression of being bored, but who, long before the
proceedings had finished, declared they had not enjoyed
so pleasant an evening since leaving home. That was it,
these kind Christian friends made that gathering so home-like,
that one could scarce fail to be happy. For a few
short hours only we rough sailors were permitted to enjoy
the refined and cultured society of our generous friends,
and it is to be hoped we came out the purer for the
contact.</p>

<p>June 24th&mdash;The sweetest pleasure has its after-pang;
the most beautiful rose its latent thorn. So, too, I see, is
it with those who undertake to narrate facts. This day
marks the loss of another shipmate, from one of those
suddenly awful deaths to which the sailor is, above all
other men, perhaps, ever liable. One of our boys,
William Edwards, whilst at work on the main crosstrees,
fell to the deck, sustaining such fearful injuries that he
died a few moments afterwards. We buried him in the
little cemetery on shore, where an unpretending gothic
cross now records the simple fact that a sailor has died.</p>

<p>After all, our ship is not entirely useless; so thinks the
admiral, for he left orders that we were to repair to
Wosung to fill up with provisions for the squadron, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>from thence to proceed to Nagasaki to await their
arrival; a feat we performed, I believe, to his entire
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Another of our old officers left us here to take command
of the "Lapwing," her captain having shot himself in
consequence of the decision of the court against him in
the affair of the late collision. Much regret was felt at
losing Mr. Haygarth&mdash;about the last of the executive
officers who commissioned us.</p>

<p>Sometime after the sailing of the squadron, we left, with
the "Zephyr" in company, to rejoin the admiral in
Posiette Bay, Siberia. But the little ship being minus
several sheets of copper, we put in at the island of Tsu-sima
to allow her effective repairs.</p>

<p>August 7th.&mdash;And now we may be said to form a
component part of the squadron; henceforth, the ships
are to follow our lead, for the St. George's cross once
more flutters from our fore-royal mast head.</p>

<p>Posiette is certainly a magnificent anchorage, capable
of accommodating many fleets. All around richly clothed
hills, admirably suited for grazing and agricultural purposes,
shelter the great sheet of water from all winds.
Nature, however, seems to hold undivided sway on those
still, solemn hills, or those broad glassy plains; for not
an animal nor house to betray the presence of the
universal devastator can be seen, though I hear that
only a short distance over the hills several thousands of
Russian soldiers are under canvas, pending the conclusion
of negociations with China, relative to Kashgar.</p>

<p>August 11th.&mdash;At noon the squadron, comprising the
following ships: "Iron Duke," "Comus," "Encounter,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>"Cura&ccedil;oa," "Pegasus," "Albatross," "Zephyr," and
"Vigilant," were signalled to get under sail, except our
ship, the "Zephyr," and the "Vigilant." Unfortunately
for the accomplishment of this evolution, the wind, after
holding out hopes that it would last all day, with the
force of the morning fell light just as the ships had
tripped their anchors. The little "Zephyr," in this
emergency, proved of invaluable service. She was here,
there, and everywhere to the rescue of her great sisters,
which could not be induced anyhow to come to the wind.
We were over four hours clearing the harbour, and even
then steam had to be got up for the purpose.</p>

<p>Next day we reached Vladivostock, anchoring in a
semicircle in front of the town. Scarce had our anchor
left the bows when another of our young lads, William
McGill, was suddenly ushered into that unknown world
that lies beyond. Whilst uncovering the mizen gaff, he
lost his hold, fell, and was so shattered that he died ere
he could be borne below. He lies in the Russian
cemetery on shore, a wild, neglected, "God's acre,"
without any pretensions to the sanctity usual to such
places. Another of the "Iron Duke's" crosses, of stout
old English oak, also marks this spot.</p>

<p>I must now request the reader to take a leap with
me&mdash;permissible enough to book writers, though scarcely
possible to pedestrians. You are now in the straits
of Tsugar, and near the scene of our former misadventure.
Before you are the ships of the squadron
drawn up in line for a race&mdash;no, not all, for the
"Mosquito" parted company during the night through
stress of weather. The breeze is now blowing at force
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>eight; or, as we should say, "slashing." During the night
we had met with a few casualties to our sails, but so slight
were they that in the morning we were able to take our
place among the coursers, as judge, referee, and starter.
At this moment the admiral signals "chase to windward."
What takes place now is a pretty sight. Clouds of snowy
balloon-like canvas spring, as if by magic, to masts and
yards, straining and bellying out with tremendous effort.
The steel corvettes were able to carry all plain sail with
impunity. Not so with the "Encounter," however, for she
is obliged to take a reef in her topsails and to furl her
royals, a proceeding which does not lessen her chance of
coming in first in the slightest, for she is known to be such
a good sailer, that a few yards of canvas, more or less,
does not affect her much. Away they go, listing over
under the strong pressure, and rising and falling in all the
majesty of ships of war. The "Pegasus" now shoots
ahead, bidding fair to overhaul the corvettes, but her
ambition is speedily curbed by the springing of her main-topsail
yard. Placed <i>hors de combat</i>, she drops astern
to shift her wounded spar. Many little accidents such as
this, calling for prompt seamanship, occurred during the
forenoon, and hence the value of such trials of speed.</p>

<p>For eight hours the squadron disported themselves in
this manner, when the "Encounter" was declared the
winner by 400 yards. At the moment of shortening sail,
our lame duck, the "Mosquito," hove in sight astern, in
a sad plight, as is usual with lame ducks. She had lost
her fore-topmast and jib-boom during the night, off
O'Kosiri. She was at once signalled to repair to
Hakodadi with all speed, to effect repairs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>By the time the race was finished we were broad off
Hakodadi, on the opposite side of the strait, but as it was
not intended to push on until next day, easy sail was kept
on until daylight.</p>

<p>September 7th.&mdash;At daybreak a man-of-war, with the
Japanese royal standard at the main&mdash;sky blue, with a
white chrysanthemum in the centre&mdash;was observed
making out of Hakodadi. Our larger ships at once
saluted, the smaller ones lowering their upper sails at the
same time. Subsequently we fell in with a Japanese
squadron, all with royal flags displayed. They were in
attendance on the mikado, who is now on a tour of his
empire.</p>

<p>By the evening we had arrived and anchored in a double
line, at right angles with the town.</p>

<p>We have, doubtless, all seen, heard, or read of the
various devices adopted by the different peoples of the
globe in the capture of the finny tribe, from our own
familiar hook and line to the Chinaman's trained cormorant
or the Chenook Indian's tame seal. These are all
good in their way, only they involve a great loss of time
and require no end of patience. But the method illustrated
to us the morning after our arrival, besides being a
more certain is also less cruel than anything else in the
shape of fishing I have yet seen. Observing a vast quantity
of fish disporting themselves near the ship, our
experimental torpedo officer armed himself with a small
torpedo, pulled himself into their midst, quietly dropped
the missile overboard, and pulled away again. The beautiful
unsuspecting creatures still played on, unconscious
of the doom that awaited them. The effect on firing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>torpedo was terrible: for a space of 150 yards all around,
the surface was like one mass of silver, from the closely-packed
and upturned bellies of a species of pilchard.
The slaughter was complete&mdash;not a fish moved after the
awful stun it had received. Boats from the squadron
were signalled to gather up the slain, which will perhaps
convey a pretty fair idea of their number.</p>

<p>Of late the admiral's barge has been attracting much
attention by her sailing qualities. She has been taken in
hand by the same energetic officer previously alluded to,
who has altered the service rig, and provided a new set of
sails, more suited in every way to develop the boat's
qualities. We had not long to wait for a challenge, for
the "Comus'" people, ever jealous in all such matters,
offered to match their sailing pinnace against her. The
challenge was accepted, and bets were concluded in the
customary manner. The admiral, in particular, was
especially pleased to think that, at last, he would have an
opportunity of verifying his remarks about his boat; for
he has reiterated again and again that, in his opinion, the
boat wanted only proper handling to go. Well, as you
know the race came off, and as you may also remember
the "Comus'" boat was beat&mdash;in common phrase&mdash;"all
to smash."</p>

<p>September 15th.&mdash;Southward once again. It was
intended to call in at Yamada on the way down, but
by some unaccountable reason we overshot the mark
and found ourselves in Kama-ichi instead. The mistake
was, of course, speedily discovered; the squadron hove
around and headed north for Yamada.</p>

<p>Next we put in to Sendai bay, a commodious anchorage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>but very much exposed seaward from its broad and unprotected
mouth. Great rollers and heavy swells come
thundering in with nearly all winds.</p>

<p>Previous to leaving, the admiral conveyed his intention
that certain ships would prepare to take the others in tow.
Acting on this the "Cura&ccedil;oa" took us and the
"Mosquito;" the "Comus," the "Albatross" and
"Zephyr;" and the "Swift," the "Lily." Thus we
started, and under these conditions logged five knots, and
all went merry until the sky began to frown, and displayed
evident signs of bad temper. Half a gale blew,
ships still towing, but cutting a violent caper because their
freedom of action was curtailed. With the night the wind
increased to a full gale, and as the ships were making the
most frantic efforts to free themselves from the imprisoning
hawsers, and likely to become bad friends over the job,
signal was made to cast off. Now in her impatience the
"Mosquito" was not content to wait until we gave her
her freedom, but proceeded to wrest herself free by pulling
one arm of our main bitts clean off to the deck.
Annoying, was it not? But this is a quality generally
conceded to mosquitoes I believe. The squadron now
re-formed under reefed canvas, and though we could see
scarcely 400 yards ahead, from the obscurity of the
weather, we managed to reel off eight and a half knots,
the "Duke" of course under steam.</p>

<p>Very cold and bleak blew the ice-cold breath of Fusi
this morning as we headed into the bay of Yedo.
Contrary to all our expectations, instead of making our
way at once to Yokohama we turned aside, and anchored
at the naval arsenal of Yokusuka, on the opposite side of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>the bay, presumably for the purpose of making the ships
presentable to the argus-eyed naval critics in Yokohama.</p>

<p>On the 24th we slipped across in gallant style, and confessedly
in first-rate order and trim. Even the "Yanks"
conceded this, with a rider, of course, to the effect that
they "guess'd" the "Alert"&mdash;did'nt they mean the
"Palos," I wonder&mdash;"would knock saucepans out of the
whole bilin'." On account of the great number of men-of-war
already at anchor we had to take up stations
as most convenient. As the flagship's anchor dropped, a
signal from main, mizen, and yard-arms, drew the attention
of the squadron. This great display of fluttering pennants
and parti-colored squares conveys to the initiated the
following sentence: "cruise at an end; satisfactory to
both officers and men."</p>

<p>September 28th.&mdash;Before the dispersal of the ships to
their winter quarters, and as a pleasant finale to an
unpleasant cruise a regatta, under the sole patronage of
the admiral and officers, was to be held on this and the
two succeeding days. The two first days were allotted to
the pulling contests, the third day to the sailing boats.
Of the pulling races it will, perhaps, suffice to say that
they were contested in the usual close and lusty manner.</p>

<p>The morn of the third day came in most auspiciously,
so far as the wind was concerned; but by mid-day heavy
rain clouds began to darken the weather horizon, and by
their aspect, threatened to mar the pleasure of the proceedings.
The race, however, had started long before
this. More than ordinary excitement was felt concerning
it, as the prize was to be a splendid silver cup, presented
by the admiral, and which he hoped&mdash;which we too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>hoped, nay, confidently expected&mdash;would be won by his
own boat. So beyond question it would had the breeze
held. But it didn't, it fell to a flat calm, with not a breath
to ripple the harbour's glassy surface. In some manner
to wipe out their late defeat, and by a persistency really
most laudable, the "Comus'" men <i>rolled</i> their pinnace
all around the course, and ended by winning the cup.
Some idea of the labour entailed on her crew may be
formed from the time at which they were at it. At 10 a.m.
the boats started, and it was not until 5 p.m. the race
finished; the crews being all this time without a drop of
water, and under a vertical sun.</p>

<p>October 9th.&mdash;We are now in Nagasaki and about to
go in dry dock on the morrow.</p>

<p>If we had previously made up our minds to any
enjoyment in Japan's westernmost port we were doomed
to disappointment, for we had not been an hour in the
bay before alarming accounts reached us of the prevalence
of a most virulent cholera on shore. Leave is of course
out of the question&mdash;provoking, to say the least of it, in
lovely Nagasaki. The captain at once issued a memo.,
couched in terms which ought to have appealed to each
man's common sense, and containing the most accurate
information with regard to the epidemic. In the face of
all this, and notwithstanding the British consul's statistics,
our men would not believe in the urgency of the case at
all; and several, despite all that could be urged against it
crossed over to the town.</p>

<p>The days in dock were not, however, allowed to pass
altogether unpleasantly or devoid of interest, for the
officers&mdash;no whit better off than we in the matter of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>leave&mdash;recognising the necessity of making an effort to divert
ennui, and to set an example of cheerfulness under
depressing circumstances, got up a series of athletic sports
on the limited space afforded by the dock. It will suffice
to notice a few of the leading items in our highly amusing
programme, for amusing it really was from beginning to
end, exemplifying to the letter the committee's motto,
"fun, not dollars," though dollars were not lacking.</p>

<p>The sports commenced at 1 p.m. on the 13th, with a
closely contested flat race of 100 yards. A sack race
which followed was, of course, rare fun, though not to
some who took the most active part in it, for I am afraid
one's nose coming in contact with hard gravel is anything
but fun to the owner of such organ. The jockey race
which came next must be noticed as exhibiting steeds in
entirely a new light. In the present instance, they so far
threw aside the nature of the equine race that, they
selected for themselves jockeys from the arms of fearful
Japanese mothers, who had come to see the fun. Clearly,
as the referees decided, this class of jockey did not come
within the scope of the programme.</p>

<p>But one of the most entertaining items was the obstacle
race, and considering, as I said before, the small space at
the committee's command, several severe obstacles had
been placed in the way of the competitors. Eighteen
entered for this race. First, half a pound of pudding,
minus anything oleaginous, and a basin of water was
administered to each. At a given signal the "gorging"
commenced. He who first got outside his "duff and
water" started, and so on with the next. One would scarce
believe with what incredible rapidity that pudding was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>metamorphosed. The next obstacle to be surmounted
was a huge balk of timber raised at the ends, about a
foot off the ground, under which the coursers were compelled
to <i>crawl</i>. A row of eighteen barrels, with the ends
knocked out, came next; then a climb up slack ropes,
and over a transverse bar; and finally another balk of
timber&mdash;if anything less than a foot off the ground&mdash;under
which they had to squeeze and wriggle in the best
manner possible.</p>

<p>As a finale to our excellent programme, the most amusing
and entertaining thing of all was yet to be carried
out. A stunsail boom had been rigged out over the
caisson, and rendered extremely fit for pedestrianism by
plentiful libations of slush and soft soap. At the extreme
end a basket containing, in the words of the programme,
"a little pig" was slung. About thirty men stood to the
front, as would-be possessors of "porcus." Each of the
thirty, as valiant heroes as ever trod a plank or fisted
handspike, tried and failed&mdash;and tried again with a like
unsatisfactory result. Piggy still lay nestled in his swinging
stye. True, once or twice he had cocked out his
head with an enquiring squeal as the pole now and then
received an extra hard shake, making the foundations of
his house rather insecure. The affair was at length
decided in an unlooked-for manner. As the thirty could
not get the pork out, the latter took the initiative and got
out himself&mdash;of course falling overboard, where he was
secured by an amphibious sailor below.</p>

<p>As the time anticipated had not been consumed in the
pork affair, a tug-of-war between the fore and aft men was
decided on; and as it is a generally understood thing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>that our men can pull on occasions, a four-and-half hemp
hawser was hauled to the front, experience having proved
that ropes of lesser diameter are like as much tow in their
hands. As no prize could be conveniently awarded
for this, about six dollars' worth of that ambiguous compound,
known as gingerbread, was supplied and laid on a
piece of canvas in a formidable heap within view of the
antagonists, with the intention that the winners might
regale themselves afterwards. But this highly laudable
and very proper intention was frustrated, for the <i>losers</i> happening
to be nearest the heap took base advantage of their
proximity to pillage the store, which, by the aid of a score
or so of Japanese imps, in all manners of reversible attitudes
in the crowd, they managed to raze to its foundations.
So ended one of the most enjoyable days of the commission.</p>

<p>By the way I must not omit to mention that the
ubiquitous "Aunt Sally," of immortal memory, was
present on the occasion, and contributed the usual amount
of sport.</p>

<p>October 14th.&mdash;By midnight, all hands having relegated
themselves to the close embraces of the sleepy god, a
terrible din and an unusual alarm was circulated throughout
the ship. At first, in our semi-wakeful state, and
before we could adjust our ideas, we had the most confused
notions of what was the matter. Most thought that
the shores under the ship's bottom had carried away, and
that we had fallen over on our bilge; and, strange to say,
in our imaginary terror our eyes seemed to convey that
impression. The ominous word "fire!" followed by the
maddening unmusical efforts of a crazed bell, reduced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>all this din and uncertainty to a logical something. But
where was it? What was on fire, the ship? Fortunately
no; but a fire so close to the ship that she was in imminent
danger of taking the flames every minute. Ahead
of us, and within a biscuit's throw of our flying boom, a
long shed containing kerosene and other inflammables
had taken fire, but how does not so clearly appear. But
that doesn't matter. In a moment there was a general
conflagration. It burst out with sudden and alarming
fierceness, threatening speedily to overwhelm the whole
yard.</p>

<p>Our captain's first consideration was the safety of his
ship. To this end the dock was flooded, and pumps rigged
on board in readiness for any possible eventuality; for,
though we were not in immediate contact with the danger,
yet it was so unpleasantly hot on our top-gallant forecastle,
and such quantities of sparks and lumps of burning wood
were so constantly lodging on our tarry ropes and rigging,
that there was no saying how soon we too might add to
the general glare.</p>

<p>The means for putting out fires in Japan are, as everybody
knows, of the most simple and primitive kind. But
simple and ineffective as their method is, we were compelled
to adopt it until there should be a sufficiency of
water in the dock to enable us to work our pumps. One
would have thought that in a Government yard like
this the machinery for pumping out the dock might have
been utilized for such a purpose. Possibly if fires were
of less frequent occurrence amongst the Japanese this
plan might be considered.</p>

<p>After the ship had been attended to we next turned our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>attention to the fire. From the first we saw it was useless
to attempt its subjugation, even had we the ordinary
appliances at hand, so our efforts were mainly directed to
the prevention of its spreading to another shed standing
near, containing vitriol, and to the preservation of a stack
of huge balks of timber, adjoining the burning shed. We
succeeded in the former, but the timber proved too
cumbrous to be interfered with, and it was not until four
o'clock in the morning that the fire was got under&mdash;or
rather, burnt itself out is, I suppose, the more correct
expression. After a good hour and half's delay a Japanese
fire brigade arrived on the scene. The appearance of
this body of men was such that they claim a few words of
description. They were attired in tight-fitting blue garments,
and mushroom-shaped hats of bamboo, with each
an umbrella over his shoulder, the use of which will
become apparent directly. Before the cortege marched a
man blowing a large conch, which emitted, not "the
murmur of the shell," but a much more ear-splitting
music. Next to him came a personage bearing the insignia&mdash;I
suppose we must term it&mdash;of the brigade. This
affair reminded me of nothing at home so much as the
stall or stand of the itinerant vendor of boot and corset
laces in our streets, the laces in this case being represented
by strips of gilded leather, and surmounted by a ball, on
which was traced a great character in gold, signifying fire,
in the language of the children of the "rising sun."
Then followed their box-like engine, borne on bamboos
across the shoulders of the main body. Notwithstanding
the ludicrousness of the whole cavalcade, the men set to
work most energetically, and displayed that dash and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>intrepidity of conduct for which the Japanese are famed,
and which must eventually raise them to the dominance
of the peoples of the far east. Right into the midst of
the fire dashed these fellows, their only shelter from the
fierce glare being the before-mentioned umbrellas. These
frail shades, though made only of paper, seemed to
answer the purpose admirably.</p>

<p>October 26th.&mdash;Left for Wosung, anchoring in the
Yang-tsze, after a quick run of four days across the
Yellow Sea. We are to await here the arrival of the
flying squadron. Meanwhile an opportunity was given
us of visiting the great European metropolis of China.
The "Foxhound" was ordered down from Shanghai, and
converted into a passenger steamer, for the benefit of our
ship's company. Shanghai at this time offered plenty of
scope for enjoyment to sailors. The city is divided into
three principal parts or "concessions"&mdash;English, French,
and American&mdash;the English being far more extensive
than the other two combined, and much more beautiful,
with clean broad streets, houses like palaces, and shops
which would do no discredit to Regent street or the
Strand. The great attraction was the races, held outside
the city, on the Nankin Road, near which is an extensive
race-course.</p>

<p>Of the native city&mdash;well&mdash;perhaps the less said the
better. It is full of the foulest filth and abominations in
which it is possible for even a Chinaman to exist. I will
not afflict my readers with a description of its horrors;
it would scarcely be fit reading for our friends. Fever
and plague are ever rife within the city gates, a fact so
well established that the European residents never visit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>this quarter. We had not been warned of this, however,
and the result was that some of our men, who had
weakened their systems with poisonous liquor, fell victims
to some disease very like cholera, which in two cases
proved fatal within twenty-four hours. I trust these
awfully terrible examples were not without their lesson to
us. (Shipmates, there is a higher aspiration within the
reach of every sailor than that of blindly devoting himself
to the service of the "boozy" god, a self-immolation
which leaves no enjoyment&mdash;no healthy enjoyment, I
mean&mdash;to its devotees. It must be, and I know it is so,
that every one such feels ashamed of himself afterwards,
and calls himself by hard but honest adjectives when the
"bad head" period comes on.) I am thankful to state
that our other cases recovered, though not until almost
all hope had well-nigh gone.</p>

<p>November 22nd.&mdash;To-day the long-expected flying
squadron arrived, and took up positions ahead of us.
The following ships comprised it&mdash;"Inconstant" (flag),
"Bacchante," "Cleopatra," "Tourmaline," and "Carysfort."</p>

<p>For days past much activity has existed amongst the
junk fleet in this neighbourhood. Dozens of these trim-built
and picturesque-looking craft have lately accumulated
here to give the princes a proper reception. Day after
day they have duly gone through some extraordinary and
to us meaningless evolutions, all flags, gongs, yells, and
gunpowder.</p>

<p>November 24th.&mdash;Leaving the squadron to the joy and
festivities of Shanghai, once more we head for Hong
Kong. We thought then it was for the last time; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>hopes have been shattered so frequently of late that we
were not prepared to bet on it.</p>

<p>Whilst at anchor, awaiting the tide to cross the outer
bar, our attendant pilot boat came to grief under our
bows. Everybody who knows anything of Chinese
rivers&mdash;of the Yangtsze in particular&mdash;will have often
remarked how great a velocity the current attains at near
low water, making boating alongside a ship an almost
impossible and extremely hazardous proceeding. The
water hisses, seethes, and boils past the sides as if the
ship was under weigh in a heavy sea; thus when the
little vessel reached our bows there was nothing to save
her. Fortunately she came down upon us in such a
manner that she escaped with the loss of mainmast and
sail, whilst a little damage was done to our head-gear
in the scrimmage.</p>

<p>November 30th.&mdash;Again the well-known rig of the
Canton fishing junks heaves in sight, and ere long the
equally well-known outline of Victoria Peak, the most
welcome sight on the station, after all said and done. In
a few hours that prince of bumboat men, old Attam, had
paid us a visit, giving us a kindly welcome, with his
good-tempered, ever-smiling, and flat celestial face.</p>

<p>December 20th.&mdash;To-day at noon the flying squadron
came in from the northward. Their arrival was awaited
by eager and expectant crowds thronging the shore, in
anticipation of witnessing the landing of the young royal
middies. In this they were disappointed. The same
absence of ceremony and reserve was to be observed
here, with respect to the queen's grandsons, as was
recently followed out in Shanghai, and which gave so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>much umbrage to the residents of that city. It was soon
officially known that whilst staying at Hong Kong, the
princes would be publicly recognised simply as "mids."</p>

<p>The Europeans and other foreign residents were quite
prepared to do the honors handsomely, had things been
ordered differently. These shortcomings were however
amply compensated for by the magnificence of the
Chinamen. It did not signify to them as to <i>how</i> the
princes were to be treated; to them they were the queen's
grandsons, midshipmen or not.</p>

<p>The two nights immediately preceding Christmas Day
were devoted to the grandest display of fireworks and
illuminations I have ever witnessed, and which, possibly,
few men see but once in a lifetime. All accounts of
China agree that in the pyrotechnic art the Chinese stand
alone, unequalled.</p>

<p>We have all, no doubt, been struck when reading of
the wonderful changes of form assumed by their fireworks
in the air. This, like many other descriptions about this
people, is rather misleading. What actually does take
place I will endeavour to show; only bear in mind the
most perfect description must fall far short of the startling
reality.</p>

<p>In the present instance two skeleton, tower-like structures
of bamboo were erected in the soldiers' drill
ground, and within this simple framework all the business
was to be transacted. Seats for the accommodation of
the governor and other high functionaries, and for the
leading Chinese, were set up at a convenient distance,
whilst the respectable public were permitted within the
enclosure. For several hours before dusk, relays of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>coolies had been bearing into the open space curious-looking
balls of wicker, innocent of anything like the
gorgeous things they really were. At sunset the programme
opened. One of the balls was hoisted to the
top of a tower, and set fire to in its ascent, so that by the
time it had reached its highest altitude it was all one
blaze. But behold the change! so sudden and brilliant
that a shout expressive of admiration was involuntarily
sent up by the sea of faces around. In place of the
homogenous ball, hundreds of small figures of mandarins
and ladies, some seated at tables, some riding on mules,
others playing at shuttlecock or flying kites, and all
clothed in the most beautiful garments, and around which
innumerable squibs were hissing and cracking, revealed
themselves to our astonished gaze. Another change!
The human element disappears. Birds and flowers, with
swarms of brilliant butterflies flitting amongst them, and
alighting on their gorgeous petals, the light all the time
ever-changing and varying in color. These in their
turn disappear, and a grand pagoda suddenly drops, as
from the skies, out of the burning mass, its different
storys all distinctly marked by parti-colored lamps,
whilst little rockets are continually going off at all its
windows. What, not finished yet? No; exit pagoda,
enter a royal crown, dominating the Prince of Wales'
feathers, with the initials "A V" and "G" underneath.
Bear in mind all these changes emanated from the <i>same</i>
ball, which was but one of scores such, and all different.
Each ball generally wound up in one tremendous report,
and a rocket, which shot far into the night, and whose
sparks, scintillating for awhile in space, rivalled in
brilliancy the tints of the stars.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>This was but the first part of the entertainment; a far
prettier was yet to come. Starting from the various
Chinese guilds, and uniting in front of the governor's
house, a grand procession, over a mile long, commenced
the perambulation of the streets of the city. Each man
bore on his shoulders exaggerated representations of all
the domestic and food animals used in the Chinese
menage, principally fish, fowls, and pigs, constructed of
bamboo framework covered with tinted gauze, and illumined
from within by colored candles. Illuminated
shops, trophies, interiors, representations in character
from the sacred books, the figures being real and resplendent
in the most beautiful silks, were amongst the most
important objects in the ceremonial. Bands of music&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;filled
up the intervals. Towards the
end of the procession came two dragons&mdash;a gold one and
a silver one&mdash;of such a length that each required somewhere
about thirty pairs of bearers. They were divided
into sections, to every one of which a pair of men was
attached, illumined from within, and covered with a rich
scaled brocade, in which the bearers themselves were also
enveloped, their legs and feet appearing from underneath
like the legs of a huge centipede.</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of dragons I may just mention a
curious ceremony I witnessed, during the earlier part of
the day, in connection with one of these&mdash;the gold one&mdash;in
the present ceremonial. The occasion was the instillation
of life into the legendary monster. He was conducted
by his bearers to the largest temple in the city, where a
yellow-robed bonze was in waiting to receive him. On
the huge head being brought to the door the farce commenced.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>Taking a live cock in his hand, the priest
pricked its comb in three several places, and with the
blood proceeded to mix some vermilion paint, in a small
china vessel. With this pigment he now described three
cabalistic signs on a piece of yellow paper, which he stuck
on the monster's forehead, at the same time touching
with his brush the eyes, the cavernous jaws, and horrible
fangs of the animal. This completes the business, and
the dragon proceeds on its sinuous way amidst the
howling and contortions of a superstitious and excited
mob.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the flying squadron
could be permitted to leave for England without the
usual challenges for boating contests being thrown out.
We, of course, came in for the lion's share of their
attacks. A match was pulled, in which our green galley
came in the victor; then a second, in which the
"Bacchante's" cutter beat our crack boat. This unexpected
defeat set our men on their metal, in fact raised a
bit of a storm in the lower deck, so that dollars were
freely tendered towards a high stake to pull them again.
But the "Bacchante" wanted not our two hundred
dollars. "They had beat us," they said, "and to their
entire satisfaction; what more could they desire?" The
"Tourmaline's" men appeared highly delighted at our
defeat. On a black board, fixed up in their fore-rigging,
they had written, "'Iron Duke' no can do 'Bacchante.'"
This was met by a counter taunt from us, "'Iron Duke'
can do 'Bacchante'&mdash;200 dollars." I am inclined to the
belief that had the "Dukes" and "Tourmalines" met on
shore that night there would have been work for the
doctors.</p>

<p class="summary">THE SECOND CRUISE OF THE CHINA SQUADRON.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;PRINCIPALLY
CONCERNING A VISIT TO THE LOO-CHOO ISLES
AND COREA.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;WELCOME NEWS FROM HOME.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>Before starting for the north, suppose we just
glance at a few of the leading events which transpired
at the beginning of the year. The flying
squadron has sailed after having awaited the return of the
"Inconstant" from docking at Nagasaki.</p>

<p>The arrival of the yacht "Wanderer" must also be
noted; for Mr. Lambert, her princely owner, gave a magnificent
cup worth 200 dollars as a prize to be sailed for
by the boats of the men-of-war in harbour. It was borne
off by the French admiral's barge.</p>

<p>In stripping our yards serious defects were discovered
in the fore and main, necessitating the replacing of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>latter by a new one, and the splicing of the former.
Whilst awaiting these repairs the admiral hurried us off,
stripped as we were, up the Canton river to a bleak open
spot above the Bogue forts. The scenery of the river is
flat and uninviting, but eminently characteristic. Almost
every hill has its pagoda at the top, every bank that
peculiar fishing apparatus&mdash;a lever net, and the river is
swarming with great lumbering junks, not a few of which,
if rumour speak correctly, engaged in piracy.</p>

<p>On the way up we obtained a fine view of the Bogue
forts. The old ruins still remain, mute witnesses of the
completeness of our cannonade during the Chinese war.
At a short distance from the old, a much stronger and
more formidable structure is reared, which in the hands
of Europeans would form an almost impassable barrier.
In addition to the large fort, two small islands off in the
river are also strongly fortified with eighteen-ton guns.</p>

<p>Ten days&mdash;such was the term of our banishment.
Economically considered, I suppose it was all right; no
doubt the fresh water of the river succeeded in removing
the saline incrustations from our bottom. One of the
home papers, more sensationally than truthfully, remarked
that our ship's company were all such a disreputable,
boosing set, and proved themselves so reckless and recalcitrant
when on shore, that the admiral took this means of
punishing us. Now I call this a gross libel on the ship's
company at large. To speak honestly, I don't believe the
admiral did send us here for such a purpose, nor do I
believe we are one whit worse than those who stigmatize
our characters in so wholesale and careless a manner.</p>

<p>Next in order of events comes the admiral's inspection&mdash;searching,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>of course, as all his inspections are known to
be. He has a curious knack of catching people on what,
in lower-deck phrase, is styled the "ground-hop," and
generally succeeds, by his rapid and pertinent questions,
in putting people into such utter confusion of ideas that
negatives and affirmatives are bundled out indiscriminately,
if indeed the mouth can be induced to open itself at all, or
to frame any speech. However, in one department, at
least, he got as good as he gave. Whilst visiting the magazine
he suddenly gave the order, "fire on the flat!"
The gunner's mate in charge of the magazine, whom we
will call "Topper," immediately closed the hatch and
stood on guard over it. Turning around, the admiral
said "I want to go into the magazine;" but observing that
"Topper" still stood motionless, he again repeated the
order. "You can't, sir," was the rejoinder, "because there
is fire in the flat." "Oh! very well," replied the admiral,
"cease fire!" With great promptitude and despatch the
hatch was removed, and the admiral prepared to descend,
but was once more checked, and was informed that if he
complied with the magazine regulations, and left his shoes
and sword behind, he might do so. He fared no better
down below, I believe, and left the magazine perfectly
satisfied with the conduct of affairs in that region.</p>

<p>A few days before sailing, a suggestion made by Mr.
Robinson, the officer whose kindnesses I have had occasion
to note before, met with universal favor. For a very
small sum each man, a telegram was sent to Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;'s
agent in London, in the following words&mdash;"When will
'Audacious' commission, and probably sail?" For
three days nothing else was spoken of, and various were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>the speculations as to the answer. It came&mdash;"Early
September." Very short, but to the point, though to
some rather ambiguous. To which did the answer refer,
the <i>commissioning</i>, or the <i>sailing</i>? Reason implied the
former, as, knowing it, the latter might be inferred. A
subsequent telegram set the matter at rest.</p>

<p>April 19th.&mdash;After a more than ordinarily long stay at
Hong Kong, to-day sees us clearing out of the harbour
on our projected summer cruise. The following ships
besides ourselves comprised the squadron&mdash;"Cura&ccedil;oa,"
"Encounter," "Albatross," "Swift," "Daring," and "Foxhound,"
with the "Vigilant" and "Zephyr," which
accompanied us out of the harbour. On parting company
with the admiral we shaped course for Manilla, the admiral
being specially careful to give Captain Tracey injunctions
not to forget to bring him 2,000 cigars from that place.
We were then sailing under sealed orders.</p>

<p>April 24th.&mdash;This morning, having sent the "Swift"
back to Hong Kong, the sealed orders were opened, and,
to the surprise of everybody&mdash;to the captain's not less
than to our own&mdash;we were not to go to Manilla at all!
This in the face of what the admiral said to the captain!
Well, up helm, and away we go for Loo-Choo; it does
not signify much where we go for the next six or eight
months, I suppose.</p>

<p>April 25th.&mdash;<i>Caught our first shark.</i> Yes; one out of
the many scores in the vicinity actually meditated an
attack on our four-pound piece. However he discovered,
to his cost, that a barbed hook is no easy matter to digest.
He was landed inboard in a trice, and handed over to
the tender mercies of the forecastle hands. Now it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>a most unfortunate thing for that shark that one of these
same <i>tender</i> hands had, that very morning, lost a "hook
pot" of fish off the range, through the kind services of
some obliging shipmate. Hence revenge was the dominant
feeling in that man's breast. Electing himself butcher-in-chief,
sharko's spirit was soon gathered to his fathers.</p>

<p>A most devilish contrivance&mdash;torpedo, electric wire,
and all complete&mdash;was invented by our torpedo officer for
the accommodation of the next friendly shark. With this
little affair safely stowed within his stomach, he would find
his internal arrangements subject to sudden and unaccountable
tension. Enough this to make the shark
parliament pass a bill condemning all illicit grabbing.</p>

<p>April 20th.&mdash;Off the east of Formosa, and during the
middle watch, the ships of the squadron were caught
aback in a sudden squall. There was a deuce of a commotion
up aloft, sails flapping and splitting, ropes cracking,
and blocks rattling till further orders. To establish order
amongst these refractory things the hands were called.
Next day the wind crept ahead and gradually freshened
to what looked and felt extremely like a gale. The poor
little "Foxhound" had a lively time of it, and proved
herself unequal to such a buffetting. The "Cura&ccedil;oa"
was signalled to take her in tow, and the two fell rapidly
astern, and finally disappeared, to rejoin us about the
third day afterwards. On May first the "Daring" parted
company for Napa, the capital of Great Loo-Choo, our
destination being Little Loo-Choo.</p>

<p>May 3rd.&mdash;I don't know if we do, but sailors ought to
feel it a great privilege that they are enabled to see all the
wonderful and varied sights so constantly surrounding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>them&mdash;the many countries and people they come in
contact with. Of all strange, out of the way, scarce
heard of places, perhaps, Loo-Choo has been less subject
to the visits of vandals from Europe than any. If I am
correctly informed it is now close on thirty years since a
ship of war put in to Little Loo-Choo, and certainly
never before such a squadron as the present.</p>

<p>But two visits of consequence have taken place during
the present century; that of Captain Maxwell in the
"Alceste," in 1817; and that of Commodore Perry, of
the U.S. navy, in 1853; so that the little we do know of
this <i>ultima thule</i> is derivable from these sources.
Strangely enough, the two accounts are broadly opposed
to each other. Captain Maxwell found the people
gentle, simple, and courteous; possessed of no money,
no arms, without police, or punishments; whilst the land,
he said, was an earthly paradise. I have in my possession
an old print entitled "the voyage of the 'Alceste,'"
written by the surgeon of that ship; and that part of it
which refers to this visit is most pleasurable reading. The
commodore, on the other hand, endeavours to shew many
of Captain Maxwell's eulogies to be erroneous. It is
certain, says he, that the Loo-Chooans possess and
understand the use of both money and arms; and that
they have a very severe and cruel code of punishment.
So far as we are able, let us judge which of the two
descriptions comes nearest the truth.</p>

<p>The Loo-Choo group of islands lies in the North
Pacific, and forms a semi-circle, extending from Japan to
the island of Formosa. The inhabitants number under
three millions, perhaps. The two principal islands of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>group are known as Great and Little Loo-Choo. It is to
the latter that the following remarks must be understood
to refer. This island is almost intersected by a
narrow arm of the sea reaching far, far away inland
amongst the richly clad hills and mountains. This,
according to the charts, is Hancock bay, up which we are
steaming. Nature is looking her best as we pass, and
wafting off to us her sweetest smells; a green summer
mantle clothes every eminence and gentle slope; and the
nestling villages have such a quiet, peaceful look, that it
seems almost a pity to disturb them&mdash;as we certainly
shall&mdash;from their dream-like repose. Each village
possesses its water mill or mills, so that the natives are
not entirely ignorant of mechanics.</p>

<p>Hundreds of canoes, of the rudest construction,
crammed with men, women, and children, put off to us
when we came to anchor. Though it is said they are of
mixed Chinese and A&iuml;no origin; the people are of cast
countenance, and style of dress peculiar to the Japanese;
they have, however, a way of doing their hair, all their
own. The men gather all theirs into a tuft at the poll,
where it is secured with a silk marling, the extreme ends
forming a sort of fringe, like a plume of feathers. The
very fine, long, and glossy hair of the women is rolled
jauntily on the top of the head in a loose spiral coil,
resembling the volutes of a shell. Through this rather
graceful head-dress they stick a long silver pin, in some
cases a foot long.</p>

<p>They appear a very timid race. This is particularly
noticeable on board. Whether it was because they saw
none of their own sex amongst us, I know not; but I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>doubt if the women saw much of what they had come to
see, as most of their time was passed in eclipse under
their husbands' lee, and whose hands they never once
loosed from the time of entering the ship until they left
us again. We treated them to sailors' fare, allowing them
the free run of our bread barges, and endeavoured all we
could&mdash;but without success&mdash;to set them at their ease.
They were all highly perfumed with the penetrating odour
of garlic. I noticed that the married ladies, in common
with A&iuml;no women, tattoo the backs of their hands, though
not their mouths.</p>

<p>One king generally suffices a people,&mdash;and even one is
often found too much&mdash;but this race tolerates <i>three</i>, or
did until very recently; one of their own; the emperor
of China, whom they call father; and the mikado of
Japan, whom they style mother. To both their "parents"
they pay an immense tribute, which annually absorbs two-thirds
of their produce. It will be inferred from this that
the condition of the lower classes is very unfavorable.</p>

<p>Since we have been on this station these islands have
been a bone of contention, between China and Japan, as
to which shall possess them; the old "father" and
"mother" farce being recognised as played out by mutual
consent. The Japs, in 1877, took the initiative, and sent
an expedition to Napa, and forcibly made the native king
prisoner; and before the Chinese were aware of what
was taking place, the Japanese were administering the
laws in all parts of the little kingdom, and gradually
absorbing it into their empire. The question between
the two nations is far from being settled yet, and may at
any future time prove a <i>casus belli</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>The appearance of the houses on shore has given rise
to not a little speculation. All that we are enabled to
make out of them from the ship is a thatched roof raised
about ten feet off the ground, and supported on four
stout uprights. Can these be dwelling houses? On
landing, and coming close up with them, we at once saw
that whatever else they were intended for, they were not
places of abode. Close under the admirably palm
thatched roof is a strongly-made, tray-shaped floor, with
a small locked door beneath the eaves. Such was their
simple structure. After a little thought, we arrived at the
conclusion that they must be granaries for the stowage of
grain, possibly the government tribute houses, as they
were of different design and vastly superior build to the
mud and stick hovels in which the people live. In their
surroundings the natives exhibit all the squalor and dirt
of China, with none of the cleanlier qualities of the
people of Japan. Though they followed us about in
droves, they never attempted any familiarities; in fact
our first overtures were treated with awe-like silence.
The only words we understood, in common with them,
were "tabac" and "Ya-pun" (Japan); indeed Japan is
the beginning and end of their ideas&mdash;their one standard
of perfection. Everything they noticed about us&mdash;watches, biscuit,
the buttons on our clothing, our <i>boots</i>
even&mdash;were all qualified with the word "Ya-pun," in a
most admiring and reverential tone. Seemingly the Loo-Chooans
have never heard of England, though on passing
a school house&mdash;wherein were about a score of children
on their knees behind a similar number of box-like
desks, one of the youngsters jumped up and shewed me
an English spelling book!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>We saw no money amongst them. They however
recognised the Japanese silver yen, but more on account
of the inscription on it than from any knowledge of its
money value, I think. Buttons were eagerly sought after.</p>

<p>Their wants seem to be extremely few and simple;
and being excellent agriculturists and expert fishers, the
land and sea amply supply these demands. Their chief
export is raw sugar. We noticed some women at rude
looms engaged in manufacturing a coarse kind of cloth
out of cocoa-nut fibre; but from its appearance most of
their wearing apparel is of Japanese fabrication. The
parents are very affectionate towards their children&mdash;who,
by the way, don't trouble their mammas for more clothes
than they were born in, until they are about seven or
eight years old.</p>

<p>The earth teems with beautiful and profuse vegetation&mdash;for
the most part in a wild state. Magnificent convolvuluses
and lilies, rare ferns&mdash;of which I gathered,
perhaps, as rare a collection&mdash;amongst them two or three
species of tree ferns, great raspberries and gooseberries;
and a very arcadia of flowers, lovely objects all for the
artist's pencil.</p>

<p>The women seem devoid of that quality we so much
admire in Englishwomen, and which is so rarely found
beyond England's shores&mdash;the quality of modesty. It is
rather embarrassing, for instance, whilst bathing to find
your clothes&mdash;which you had left on the beach&mdash;the centre
of an admiring and criticising crowd of ladies, handling
and trying on each separate article of your rather intricate
wardrobe, and wishing, no doubt, the owner would swim
to shore and help them in their efforts. Such unaffected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>simplicity and ingenuousness is most refreshing to witness.</p>

<p>How extremely alike child nature is all over the world!
Observing a little half-famished girl in a canoe alongside,
I handed her a piece of jam tart through the port. At
first she was at a loss what to do with it, but soon following
out an universal law in such cases, she ventured to put
it to her mouth. The result may be expected; for no
matter how widely tastes differ, every child likes jam. It
was real good to see the hearty way in which that copper-skinned
maid smacked her tiny cherry lips, and looked
her grateful thanks through her great lustrous almond
eyes. With the intention, perhaps, of sharing the
delicacy with her brothers and sisters, who shall say? she
carefully wrapped up the remainder, and placed it inside
her only garment. How often, dear reader, have you and
I not done similarly at school feasts? Though this little
Loo-Choo's heart was willing, the flesh was weak; the
parcel was again taken out, re-examined, and re-tasted&mdash;but
with evident reluctance&mdash;till, finally, after a few
ineffectual efforts to overcome selfishness, the whole was
consumed.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to be able to write that in their dealings
with this simple people our men acted always with
kindness and consideration; paying, or offering payment&mdash;for
it was generally refused&mdash;for everything they had.</p>

<p>The arrival of the "Swift" with our mails was the signal
for our departure from pleasant Loo-Choo.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be remembered that just about this
time English society at home seems to have undergone a
mental crisis which, at one time, certainly threatened the
fabric of its reason; and all about that absurd pachyderm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>"Jumbo." Of course, more or less, any agitation emanating
from home must in time reach Englishmen abroad;
thus the "Jumbo" wave visited these seas, and day after
day, week after week, it was nothing but "Jumbo." You
would have thought the whole ship's company was
sickening for elephantiasis. Some funny fellow in the
squadron noticing this weakness, attached the name to our
ship which, amongst the blue jackets at least, has entirely
supplanted the original one. But this by the way.</p>

<p>Well, we reached Nagasaki without accident; coaled,
and left for Kob&eacute;,&mdash;south of Kiusiu&mdash;with a rattling
breeze fair abaft. All went smoothly until we arrived off
Satano-Misaki, the southernmost point of Kiusiu. The
word "Satano," if it be, as is said, of Portuguese origin,
needs no comment. Here the fine breeze forsook us, and
left us in a flat and quite unexpected calm; for, generally
speaking, in rounding this cape the reverse of calms is met
with. To make matters still more unpleasant, a heavy
ground swell began to set through the straits, and the
squadron having fires drawn at the time we all found
ourselves in the doldrums. Still, however, there was
something of a current which had its effect on the ships,
so that it was impossible to keep in anything like station.
In this state of affairs the "Cura&ccedil;oa" drifted on top of
the "Daring," and cracked her up a bit, rendering extensive
repairs to her absolutely necessary. She was
despatched on to Kob&eacute; for this purpose.</p>

<p>After varying fortunes, now a calm&mdash;anon a gale, we
arrived at Kob&eacute; on June 3rd. This makes the sixth time
during the commission we have touched at this place,
and strange coincidence! on fives times out of the six we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>have anchored at noon, and have dined off that delightful
compound, pea-soup, on entering the harbour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the admiral and the "Swift" are away in
Corea, negociating a treaty with that nation.</p>

<p>On reaching Yokohama we found our anticipated
pleasures doomed to disappointment; for that yearly
visitant, cholera, was holding high revel in the town, and
doing pretty well just as it pleased. Nevertheless, the
admiral arrived the previous day, and gave leave to the
squadron until 9 p.m., with injunctions against visiting
certain localities.</p>

<p>A few days subsequently we were joined by the
"Cleopatra," late of the flying squadron, but detached at
Suez for service on this station. The "Comus," meanwhile,
is about to leave for the Pacific to replace the
"Champion," ordered to join our flag.</p>

<p>In spite of the precautions supposed to have been
observed, cholera at length discovered itself in the fleet;
and on the 27th June a case from the "Vigilant" and
another from the "Encounter," were conveyed to the
hospital. At once further restrictions were placed on the
leave, and though not absolutely stopped it was curtailed
to sundown.</p>

<p>July 2nd.&mdash;Resumed our cruise (now under the admiral)
to the northward. The "Foxhound," outside, was
signalled to repair to Hong Kong, and the "Zephyr"
ordered up to take her place. The "Foxhound" has
shewn herself to be a most indifferent sailer and steamer,
and not at all suited as a handy auxiliary to the squadron.</p>

<p>July 5th.&mdash;Four years in commission to-day! Are we
ever to hear anything of our relief? I think we shall be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>preparing for eventualities if we meditate a serious study
of the Chinese and kindred languages to fit us for an
indefinite stay in the far east. Have they forgotten us at
home?</p>

<p>On the passage to Hakodadi the "Cleopatra" and
"Cura&ccedil;oa" each lost a poor fellow, of cholera. Thus it
is evident had we not cleared out of Yokohama when we
did the epidemic might have taken alarming hold on the
squadron.</p>

<p>We have left Hakodadi, and are now cruising up the
gulf of Tartary to as far north as our first year's round.
Passing by Dui we braced sharp up, encountering, with
double reefs, a strong wind and heavy sea for the sixty
miles stretch across to Castries bay, making that anchorage
in a dense fog. Hence we recrossed to Dui,
coaled, and continued southward to Barracouta harbour.
For the future this anchorage will possess a melancholy
interest for the "Cleopatra;" for, a day before sailing,
the squadron was startled to hear that a shocking and
fatal occurrence had happened to an officer of that ship,
who was unfortunately shot through the inadvertent discharge
of a fowlingpiece. He was an officer much beloved
by the ship's company.</p>

<p>August 12th.&mdash;A day's sail from Vladivostock we fell in
with the "Champion," one of the "Cura&ccedil;oa" class. I
suppose, from her appearance, black must be the uniform
of the Pacific station, a color which looks confessedly
proper and ship-shape, but one which our admiral will not
allow on any account.</p>

<p>On arriving at Vladivostock, scraping operations were
commenced on her, and by the following morning early
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>her crew had greeted us with "Good-bye, 'Jumbo,'"
which they had erased in great straggling letters along one
broadside.</p>

<p>Our last mails, brought up by the "Zephyr," have narrowly
escaped total destruction&mdash;at least such might have
been the fate of one of them; for the steamer conveying
it to Yokohama struck on a rock in the Inland Seas, and
foundered&mdash;the mails being immersed for so long a period
that when our letters reached us they were reduced to
what Sala would call an "epistolary pulp." But no news
came of the "Audacious," only what the poor mothers
and wives say.</p>

<p>August 24th.&mdash;For the first time during our already
long commission we are about to make an acquaintance
with the "hermit kingdom"&mdash;that, I believe, is what one
writer calls Corea. Japan has for a number of years held
a sort of <i>quasi</i> intercourse with this country, and has even
gone so far as to send an embassy to the court at Seoul,
and to establish two or three settlements along the coast
within the last two years. But the Coreans, taking their cue
from their suzerain, China, have ever looked with a jealous
eye on the Japanese and any other foreign relations. However,
China's Bismarck, the astute Li-hung-Chang, has
recently altered his tactics, and is now as anxious that
Corea should enter into the community of nations as he
was before, that it should stand outside; thus, when our
admiral, at the beginning of the recent treaty, solicited
the prime minister's aid it was readily given; for, argued
he, what Corea, concedes to foreigners surely China has a
right to demand.</p>

<p>Since we have been on this station two countries have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>attempted to enter into treaty relations with Corea&mdash;the
"Vittor Pinani," for Italy, in 1880, and Commodore Shufeldt,
for America, in the "Ticonderego," in the same
year; but both, I believe, have resulted in failure&mdash;the
first because, instead of the Italians calling China to their
aid, they relied too much on the mediations of Japan, a
nation whom the Coreans mortally detest: and the second
because, though Li-hung-Chang was the medium, Corea,
whilst admitting her inferiority to China, claimed equality
with America, or with any other of the great civilized
powers.</p>

<p>Of course no European nation is willing to concede so
much; hence, for the present, that treaty is annulled. It
remains to be seen if ours is a more honorable one or
not.</p>

<p>At present Corea is in a state bordering on anarchy.
Sundry rumours have reached us recently of some disturbance
south. So far as I am able to glean, this is
what is actually occurring. The late king dying without
issue, his adopted son, the present king, ascended the
throne. During his minority his father acted as regent&mdash;a
position the latter found to suit him so well that,
by-and-by, when his son became of age he refused to
abdicate the throne in favor of its lawful occupant, threw
off all semblance of allegiance, and assumed a high-handed
and arrogant bearing, especially exhibited towards
the queen and her family, with whom the regent was at
bitter feud. To compass their destruction was then his
first care, and he openly declared to the mutinous palace
guard that their grievances would not be redressed until
they had compassed the queen's death. He even suggested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>to them how they were to set about it&mdash;nay, even
offered to aid them. On a certain night during last July,
and according to previous arrangement, the soldiers
repaired to the palace, shouting "the queen, death to
the queen." That innocent lady, turning to her unnatural
father-in-law, asked what the shouting meant and what the
people wanted of her? and he, pretending to advise her
for her good, told her that rather than live to be outraged
by the soldiers it was better she should die by her own
hand, at the same time placing a cup of poison before
her, which she in her extremity actually drank, sharing it
with her son's wife, a girl only eleven years old. The
king was compelled to seek safety in flight, and according
to last accounts is still in hiding.</p>

<p>The regent, now left master of the situation, next
turned the people against the Japanese embassy, of whom
there were twenty-eight in all. The subsequent adventures
of this little band of brave men reads more like a page of
a romance than a fact of to-day's occurrence. After fighting
their way through immense odds&mdash;crossing rivers in
open boats amidst flights of stones and arrows&mdash;lying
down to rest, to find themselves, on awaking, surrounded
by a revengeful and infuriated people&mdash;they at length
reached the shore to find no junk or vessel of sufficient
size to convey them across the narrow sea to their own
country. Driven to face their enemies on the very verge
of the ocean, they eventually succeeded in retreating to
some small boats&mdash;in which, wounded and bleeding, but
all alive, they confided themselves to the sea, as being
more merciful than their relentless and cruel foe. All
this, I say, savours of the romantic. Fortunately for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>poor worn-out voyagers help was at hand, for soon H.M.S.
"Flying Fish" hove in sight, on board which they were
kindly received, and brought to Nagasaki.</p>

<p>These stirring events have actually occurred whilst we
have been lying quietly at anchor, in Gen San and Chosan.
Under such a state of affairs, who shall predict the fate
of Admiral Willes' treaty?</p>

<p>I trust I may be pardoned for being thus prolix; but
surely, we who are actually on the scene of events ought
not to be more ignorant of what is going on in our
immediate neighbourhood than our friends who are so
many thousands of miles removed from it.</p>

<p>I cannot say much of the Coreans, for, in the first
place, the usual sources of information are almost silent
on the subject, there being about only one reliable
English work on Corea; and secondly we have no means,
had we the desire, to study this people, who are so jealous
of their women that they wont allow you to approach
within a mile of their dwellings. On one occasion I
remember I sought, for the purposes of this present
narrative, to set aside this prohibition, and feigning
ignorance of it I penetrated to the outskirts of a village,
when half-a-dozen big fellows rushing up to me, and
gesticulating, I thought it advisable to "boom off."
However, I saw what I had ventured thus far to see,
notwithstanding&mdash;one of their women; but I am afraid
an ugly specimen of the sex. So far does this feeling
prevail that they would not permit even our admiral's
lady to satisfy a woman's curiosity about women; though
the chief of the village did condescend to allow her to sit
beside him on his mat, and even went so far as to offer
her a <i>smoke of his pipe</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>One of the accounts of their origin is peculiar. A
certain beautiful goddess once descended from the
celestial regions and sojourned in Corea. But it would
appear that she left her hat behind, for shortly after
arrival she received a sun-stroke, which caused her to lay
an egg of abnormal size, out of which there stepped&mdash;minerva-like&mdash;a
full blown Corean of gigantic stature.
This young fellow, in one of his incursions into the
mountains, one day returned to his mamma with a
beautiful white-skinned maid whom he had picked up in
a fairy bower. His mother was not at all pleased&mdash;so the
story goes&mdash;with this maid of earth, and made it so hot
for her that in a fit of rage the son, whom she had
hatched with such tender solicitude, slew her. Remorseful
at the deed, he swore that henceforth a similar
misfortune should never again occur to any man; hence
the seclusion of the women. I need scarcely add that
from this stalwart first Corean and his pale bride all the
present race is descended.</p>

<p>The mandarin at Gen San came on board, attended
with great ceremony&mdash;flags, banners, pennons, soldiers,
and trumpeters, in boat loads; the latter gentlemen being
furnished with brass instruments, such as angels are
usually depicted with, but which can be made to shut up
like a telescope to vary the music. The men are certainly
a fine race&mdash;tall and upright as an arrow, and rather
intelligent looking than otherwise. They wear long
coarsely-fabricated, white cotton garments, split up
behind, in front and on the hips&mdash;all tails in fact; but
the great national peculiarity seems to be the hats, some
made of bamboo, others of horse hair, of very delicate net
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>or gauze work, and shaped like a reversed flower pot with
a rim attached. Its purpose cannot be to keep the head
warm, to protect it from the rain, or to answer any
other purpose to which a hat may be applied: for
instance you could not get a drink of water by means of
it, nor would it serve as a pillow. The ordinary color of
these hats is black, but in consequence of the queen's
demise they now don a white one&mdash;white being, as in
China, the symbol of mourning. Some who cannot
afford, or have not the inclination, to purchase a white
one, paste a patch of white paper over the crown of the
black one which answers the purpose just as well.</p>

<p>They betray a weakness for rum, and a knowledge of
the vessels in which it is usually issued on board a
man-of-war, scarcely credited of a people who have so few
means of acquiring such familiarity. But so it is, and if
noses can be accepted as indices of truth in such matters,
something stronger than water has been used in tinting
them.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the party presented the appearance of
guys, rather than men of "fight." What do you say to a
mixed uniform of pink and light blue glazed calico, over
dingy under-garments of impossible analysis, and a mushroom
hat of the coarsest felt, with the distinguishing red
horse hair attached to the crown; wooden shot and
powder pouches of the roughest and rudest make slung
across the shoulders by a piece of thin cord? And such
shot! irregular pellets of raw iron and lead, of which all
I can say is that dying by such help would be far from
an &aelig;sthetic operation. And yet these same soldiers, as a
mere pastime, are employed in a service which requires
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>no mean bravery. When not fighting the two-legged
enemies of their country, they are engaged waging war
against the four-legged ones, their land being infested
with tigers of great size and strength.</p>

<p>In the evening the local mandarin sent a present of
fruits, fowls, eggs, vegetables, and a pig, to the admiral.
"Dennis," however, made a terrible fuss at the prospect of
being converted into a toothsome dish for the sailors, and
sent up such a squeal, in choicest pig-Corean&mdash;piercing,
prolonged, torturing&mdash;that the band was compelled to
cease, in the midst of the most pathetic part of "<i>La
Traviata</i>," out of respect of his superior music.</p>

<p>As the ladies of this country are for ever immured
within the four mud walls of their houses, the men have
usurped a right generally conceded to females, namely,
that of indicating by some sign their state in life&mdash;married or single.
The married men do their hair up in
a knot at the top of the head; those who have not yet
seen the girl they like better than themselves wear theirs
in a loose trace behind; whilst some others who have
successfully passed through both states, and are quite
willing to try it again&mdash;for marriage amongst them is
honorable and universal, as in China&mdash;indicate this desire
by donning a sort of skull cap. I thought it not a little
curious that the men, and not the women, should take
the initiative in this matter. Men, in general, after
having committed a mistake, don't like to admit it.</p>

<p>After Gen-San we moved a little further south to
Chosan, where, scarce had we anchored, when the arrival
of a small steamer threw the whole squadron into violent
commotion. She had been chartered either by Sir
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>Thomas Wade or Sir Harry Parkes expressly to convey
despatches to the admiral&mdash;what the subject was none of us
could even guess, though it subsequently leaked out that
a disturbance of some sort had broken out at Foo-Choo.
The "Zephyr" was at once signalled to raise steam; and
all the admiral's staff were warned to hold themselves in
readiness to turn over to the "Vigilant" on the following
day. Next morning the admiral sailed, preceded by the
"Cleopatra" by a few hours, and followed by the "Swift."</p>

<p>September 12th.&mdash;We are now at Port Hamilton, and
drawing towards the end of our cruise. The "Vigilant"
came in this morning with Mrs. Willes on board to
witness the regatta got up for the squadron. It was a
success in every way&mdash;especially so to the crew of our
first cutter; in fact a more than average share of prizes
fell to "Jumbo." I quote the flag borne by our boats
(arms, an elephant passant-argent; motto, "Jumbo").
The sailing races were to have come off the following day,
but at daybreak it was blowing so hard, and the barometer
falling so rapidly, that a second anchor had to be
dropped. On the gale increasing cable was veered; and
it went on increasing until a third anchor was let go.</p>

<p>The third day came in fine, with a breeze all that could
be desired. To prevent loss of time, and to simplify
matters, all the boats, of no matter what race, started at
once. It was a pretty sight to witness this mosquito
fleet clapping on sail after sail&mdash;balloons, outriggers, skyjibs,
and other extraordinary bits of duck. Our second
cutter&mdash;under the joint control of the commander and
Mr. Alexander, midshipman&mdash;went around in splendid
style, the man&oelig;uvring of Mr. Alexander being beyond all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>praise. She came in first, and carried off the admiral's
cup. The whaler was managed equally well by Mr. Patey,
and came in an excellent second.</p>

<p>This regatta brought the cruise practically to an end,
though each ship has to repair to Chefoo for provisions,
independently of the other.</p>

<p>On the passage we ran against something dirty, which
succeeded in whipping our main-topsail clean off the yard,
and left it dangling by the starboard sheet, at the lower
yard-arm; and as misfortunes don't happen singly, the jib
made most energetic and partially successful efforts to
hang up beside it. It did not reach quite so far aft as
that, but it did manage to coil itself around the fore yard
arm. Such a terrific squall we have never encountered
before. And such lightning and rain! who ever saw the
like?</p>

<p>But joyful news was awaiting us at Chefoo. Mr.
Robinson, in fulfilment of a promise he made on leaving
us at Nagasaki, telegraphed the welcome, long-expected
intelligence that the "Audacious" commissioned on the
5th instant.</p>

<p>And now, dear shipmates, I must leave you, and I do
so at once regretfully and joyfully; regretfully, that I
have to bid farewell to what has given me not a little
pleasure to write; joyfully, that I have&mdash;as I would fain
hope&mdash;been enabled to bring my narrative to a successful
termination. If any of you are disappointed that I have
not pursued it further, think how necessary it was that
my manuscript should be in the printer's hands as
speedily as possible. I thought no more opportune
ending could have offered itself to me than the telegram
before quoted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>If "In Eastern Seas" shall have in the slightest degree
contributed one pleasure to you or your friends, or shall
be the humble instrument of calling to your mind some
pleasant memories of the commission, I shall indeed
feel amply rewarded for any little trouble I may have
been put to in helping you to such pleasure or to such
memories.</p>

<p>We have seen many lands together, many and strange
peoples, much that is delightful beyond description in
this, our beautiful world; but, after all, one feels his
soul filled with enthusiasm at the thought that he is an
Englishman, though he may be but a sailor. Persons at
home scarcely realise what an inheritance that is.</p>

<p>In conclusion, may we all find happy homes; happy
mothers, wives, sisters, and sweethearts, all the more
willing to treasure us because we have been loyal to them
for such a long, long time. I don't drink&mdash;as you know&mdash;but
I don't mind cracking a bottle of lemonade to the
future success in life, and happiness of all my
late, much-respected, shipmates. God bless them all.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Transcriber's Notes:</b></p>

<p class="p2">Every effort has been made to keep to the original text as much as
possible. Non-standard spelling and grammar have been mostly preserved.
Changes have only been made in the case of obvious typographical
errors, and where not making a correction would leave the text
confusing or difficult to read. There is a fair amount of inconsistency
in the author's transliteration of foreign words, especially in place
and person names. Such inconsistency has been mostly preserved but in
some cases names have been made more recognizable or the spelling has
been standardized so that it is easier for the reader to follow the
author's narrative. All changes are documented below.</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in the hyphenation of words preserved. (ahead, a-head;
bluejackets, blue-jackets; cocoanut, cocoa-nut; eyebrows, eye-brows;
Gen San, Gen-San; ironclad, iron-clad; Loo Choo, Loo Choo; outlined,
out-lined; ricksha, rich-sha; seaboard, sea-board; semicircle,
semi-circle; sundown, sun-down; stokehole, stoke-hole; Tientsin,
Tien-tsin; Tsusima, Tsu-sima; topgallant, top-gallant; Yangtsze,
Yang-tsze;)</p>

<p>The author's inconsistent style of making a diary entry has been
preserved. In some cases, a date is followed by a period and emdash and
then the entry proper. In others, there is a date, no period and an
emdash. In yet others, the date is followed by a comma and then the
entry proper.</p>

<p>Pg. 7, word "smart&#8216;", in the original there was a lefthand or opening
single quote mark just after the letter "t" and the whole word
including the single quote mark was enclosed in double quote marks. The
opening single quote mark is more plausibly a comma which printer has
placed upside down. Changed to comma. (we are told he is "smart,"
meaning, of course, that)</p>

<p>Pg. 8, "fete" grave accent changed to circumflex, matching spelling on
page 289. (a sort of f&ecirc;te was made of it)</p>

<p>Pg. 10, period after "aft" changed to comma, which is more appropriate
in the context. (two forward and two aft, that they may be discharged)</p>

<p>Pg. 20, "aud" changed to "and". (beer and stout, and something)</p>

<p>Pg. 21, duplicated word "are" removed (we are invited to insert our
names)</p>

<p>Pg. 28, "Pontellaria" changed to "Pantellaria", to match spelling later
in the same paragraph. (for Pantellaria&mdash;an island of more interest)</p>

<p>Pg. 30, "criental". The word "oriental" might possibly have been
intended, however, the original text is preserved. (criental love for
colour)</p>

<p>Pg. 31, "ubiquitious May" changed to "ubiquitous Mary". The phrase
"ubiquitous Mary" seems more appropriate in context, changed
accordingly. (who does not know Mary the ubiquitous Mary)</p>

<p>Pg. 50, "laterel" changed to "lateral". (by dint of a little lateral
pressure)</p>

<p>Pg. 54, "Simatra" changed to "Sumatra". (off Acheen head, in Sumatra)</p>

<p>Pg. 56, "liries" changed to "lories", seems more appropriate in
context. (doves, pigeons, lories, and humming birds)</p>

<p>Pg. 61, "to the Hindoo god Brahin". Unclear what author's intended to
refer to: "Brahmin", "Brahma" are among several possibilities. The
author's original text is preserved.</p>

<p>Pg. 61, "becomiug" changed to "becoming". (becoming a fixture by
planting his feet)</p>

<p>Pg. 64, "Lebaun" changed to "Labuan", to match spelling elsewhere in
the text. (Coaling is a long process at Labaun)</p>

<p>Pg. 72, "Rowloon" changed to "Kowloon". (the peninsula of Kowloon)</p>

<p>Pg. 72, "wont". Throughout the text, when "wont" is used as a
contraction for "will not" or "would not" the author did not insert
an apostrophe. This original style is preserved in all instances. In
other contexts the author also uses "wont" to mean "habitually".</p>

<p>Pg. 74, "Cirea" changed to "Corea", matching the spelling elsewhere in
the text for the country now more commonly called "Korea". (beyond it
in Japan, Corea, and)</p>

pyrotechnical compositions)</p>

<p>Pg. 85, "univeral" changed to "universal". (there is but one universal
fashion of garment)</p>

<p>Pg. 91, "as" changed to "at", which seems more appropriate in
context. (arsenal was built at Foo-Choo)</p>

<p>Pg. 92, ship name "Eyera". Author was possibly referring to "Egeria",
an English warship which is also mentioned elsewhere in the text.
Original spelling preserved.</p>

<p>Pg. 92, ship name "Monocasy". Author was most likely referring to the
USS Monocacy but the author's original spelling is preserved as it is a
plausible rendering of an unfamiliar name as he heard it.</p>

<p>Pg. 94, a closing double quote mark is presumed after the word
"delight" and has been inserted. ("unqualified expressions of
delight,")</p>

<p>Pg. 96, "Yeso" also spelled "Yesso" and "Yezo" elsewhere in the text.
The original text is preserved in all instances.</p>

<p>Pg. 97, "panace" changed to "panacea", seems more appropriate and
easily understood in the context. (was the panacea he sought)</p>

<p>Pg. 98, "Sintor", elsewhere, also "Sintoo". This refers to the Japanese
religion now more commonly spelled "Shinto". However, the author's
original spelling is preserved as they are plausible transliterations
of the foreign words as heard by an English seaman with no knowledge of
Japanese.</p>

<p>Pg. 98, "Kivto" changed to "Kioto", matching spelling elsewhere in the
text. This refers to the Japanese city now more commonly spelled
"Kyoto". (to the holy city, Kioto, where)</p>

<p>Pg. 108, "by putting on, in addition their long gown" would read more
smoothly as "by putting on, in addition to their long gown". The word
"to" has been added. (by putting on, in addition to their long gown, a
European hat)</p>

<p>Pg. 110, "coure" changed to "course". (only of course on a much more
gigantic)</p>

context. (effect of light and shade playing)</p>

<p>Pg. 119, "Fusi-yama" refers to the mountain now more commonly spelled
Fujiyama. The author's original spelling is preserved as it is a
plausible rendering of an unfamiliar word as he heard it.</p>

<p>Pg. 119, comma after "days" changed to period, seems more appropriate
in context. (of a few days. Few sights are likely)</p>

<p>Pg. 120, "usuage" changed to "usage". (the common usage of maritime
nations)</p>

<p>Pg. 121, "part" changed to "port", seems more appropriate in context.

appropriate in context. (The two nationalities I have mentioned seem)</p>

text preserved in both instances.</p>

<p>Pg. 159, "unusal" changed to "unusual". (such heavy and unusual
evolutions)</p>

<p>Pg. 161, "billets deux" changed to "billets doux", seems
more appropriate in context. (six or eight <i>billets doux</i>.)</p>

<p>Pg. 162, "bumbed". The author might possibly have intended "bumped" but
unclear, so original text preserved. (From the manner in which the
cable "surged" and bumbed)</p>

<p>Pg. 162, "their was still" changed to "there was still", seems more
appropriate in context. (and as there was still a big lump of a sea on)</p>

<p>Pg. 163, "Golo islands". Author was probably referring to the "Goto
islands". However the author's original spelling is preserved as it is
a plausible transliteration of an unfamiliar word as he heard it.</p>

<p>Pg. 166, comma changed to period at end of sentence. (their sex. Can it
be that this is)</p>

<p>Pg. 168, "da&iuml;mios". This is also spelled "daimio" without diaeresis
above the "i" elsewhere in the text. The original spellings have been
preserved in all instances.</p>

<p>Pg. 173, "unusal" changed to "unusual". (presence of an unusual number
of jelly-fish)</p>

<p>Pg. 175, "Liminoseki" likely to be "Simonoseki", as mentioned on page
99 and also as "Simoneski" on pages 113 and 153, both plausible
transliterations. The author was most likely referring to the place now
more commonly spelled "Shimonoseki". Changed to "Simonoseki". (we had
cleared the strait of Simonoseki, we fell in with)</p>

<p>Pg. 176, "legecy" changed to "legacy". (come into a legacy from some of
his)</p>

<p>Pg. 178 and 179, ship name "Th&egrave;mis" is more correctly spelled "Th&eacute;mis"
and "Themis". The original spelling is preserved in all instances as
all are plausible renderings on the part of the author and there is no
ambiguity in reference.</p>

<p>Pg. 183, original text "January 28th" probably ought to read "February
28th" in order to conform to the chronological sequence. Changed
accordingly. (February 28th.&mdash;So quietly, that the)</p>

<p>Pg. 185, "populaton" changed to "population". (The native population is
Anamese)</p>

<p>Pg. 188, "gulf of Ne-chili" changed to "gulf of Pe-chili". (for

of coming in first in the slightest)</p>

<p>Pg. 192, period changed to comma after "sail". (At the moment of
shortening sail, our lame duck)</p>

<p>Pg. 195, place name "Yokusuka" also spelled "Yokosuka" elsewhere in the
text. Both are plausible transliterations and so the original is
preserved in all cases.</p>

<p>Pg. 196, "pupose" changed to "purpose". (for the purpose of making the
ships)</p>

<p>Pg. 204, missing period at sentence end, added. (in this neighbourhood.

ease. They were all)</p>

<p>Pg. 225, ship name "Vittor Pinani" is more correctly spelled "Vittor
Pisani" on page 143. The author's original spelling is preserved as it
is a plausible rendering of an unfamiliar name as he heard it and there
is little ambiguity. Also closing double quote mark added after
"Pinani". (the "Vittor Pinani," for Italy, in 1880)</p>

<p>Pg. 225, ship name "Ticonderego" is more correctly spelled
"Ticonderoga". However, the author's original spelling is preserved as
it is a plausible rendering of an unfamiliar name as he heard it and
there is little ambiguity.</p>

<p>Itinerary, entry for 1879, August 9, point of departure "Hakodat&eacute;".
This should probably read "Hakodadi", a spelling which is used in the
entry just above and also, consistently, elsewhere in the text
(although the place name is in fact more commonly spelled Hakodate
today). The difference in spelling between the names in the two
adjacent itinerary entries is rather easy to spot, and so the
inconsistency is puzzling. To allow for the possibility that the author
might well have spotted the inconsistency and chose, for whatever
reason, to let it remain, the original text is preserved.</p>

<p>Itinerary, entry for 1880, August 3, point of departure, "Okisiri
Island". This should probably read "O'Kosiri Island", a spelling used
in the entry just above and elsewhere in the text, being a place of
some importance in the narrative. However the original spelling is
preserved for the same reasons as for "Hakodat&eacute;" above.</p>
